	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) researchers have been developing and refining large language models ({LLMs}) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by {OpenAI}, {GPT}-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of {GPT}-4, when it was still in active development by {OpenAI}. We contend that (this early version of) {GPT}-4 is part of a new cohort of {LLMs} (along with {ChatGPT} and Google's {PaLM} for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous {AI} models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, {GPT}-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, {GPT}-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as {ChatGPT}. Given the breadth and depth of {GPT}-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence ({AGI}) system. In our exploration of {GPT}-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of {AGI}, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

Most importantly, we provide a detailed discussion about the use and non-use cases of large language models for various natural language processing tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks, traditional natural language understanding tasks, natural language generation tasks, emergent abilities, and considerations for specific tasks.We present various use cases and non-use cases to illustrate the practical applications and limitations of {LLMs} in real-world scenarios. We also try to understand the importance of data and the specific challenges associated with each {NLP} task. Furthermore, we explore the impact of spurious biases on {LLMs} and delve into other essential considerations, such as efficiency, cost, and latency, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of deploying {LLMs} in practice. This comprehensive guide aims to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights and best practices for working with {LLMs}, thereby enabling the successful implementation of these models in a wide range of {NLP} tasks.

First, we investigate scaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B parameters) and 4 model types: a plain language model ({LM}); an {LM} prompted to be helpful, honest, and harmless; an {LM} with rejection sampling; and a model trained to be helpful and harmless using reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}). We find that the {RLHF} models are increasingly difficult to red team as they scale, and we find a flat trend with scale for the other model types. Second, we release our dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for others to analyze and learn from. We provide our own analysis of the data and find a variety of harmful outputs, which range from offensive language to more subtly harmful non-violent unethical outputs. Third, we exhaustively describe our instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red teaming. We hope that this transparency accelerates our ability to work together as a community in order to develop shared norms, practices, and technical standards for how to red team language models.},

For example, summarization models are often trained to predict human reference summaries and evaluated using {ROUGE}, but both of these metrics are rough proxies for what we really care about---summary quality. In this work, we show that it is possible to significantly improve summary quality by training a model to optimize for human preferences.  We collect a large, high-quality dataset of human comparisons between summaries, train a model to predict the human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to fine-tune a summarization policy using reinforcement learning. We apply our method to a version of the {TL};{DR} dataset of Reddit posts and find that our models significantly outperform both human reference summaries and much larger models fine-tuned with supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer to {CNN}/{DM} news articles, producing summaries nearly as good as the human reference without any news-specific fine-tuning.  We conduct extensive analyses to understand our human feedback dataset and fine-tuned models.  We establish that our reward model generalizes to new datasets, and that optimizing our reward model results in better summaries than optimizing {ROUGE} according to humans.  We hope the evidence from our paper motivates machine learning researchers to pay closer attention to how their training loss affects the model behavior they actually want.},

For stylistic continuation we achieve good results with only 5,000 comparisons evaluated by humans.

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the {OpenAI} {API}, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune {GPT}-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models {InstructGPT}. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter {InstructGPT} model are preferred to outputs from the 175B {GPT}-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, {InstructGPT} models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public {NLP} datasets. Even though {InstructGPT} still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

	abstract = {The medical codes prediction problem from clinical notes has received substantial interest in the {NLP} community, and several recent studies have shown the state-of-the-art ({SOTA}) code prediction results of full-fledged deep learning-based methods. However, most previous {SOTA} works based on deep learning are still in early stages in terms of providing textual references and explanations of the predicted codes, despite the fact that this level of explainability of the prediction outcomes is critical to gaining trust from professional medical coders. This raises the important question of how well current explainability methods apply to advanced neural network models such as transformers to predict correct codes and present references in clinical notes that support code prediction. First, we present an explainable Read, Attend, and Code ({xRAC}) framework and assess two approaches, attention score-based {xRAC}-{ATTN} and model-agnostic knowledge-distillation-based {xRAC}-{KD}, through simplified but thorough human-grounded evaluations with {SOTA} transformer-based model, {RAC}. We find that the supporting evidence text highlighted by {xRAC}-{ATTN} is of higher quality than {xRAC}-{KD} whereas {xRAC}-{KD} has potential advantages in production deployment scenarios. More importantly, we show for the first time that, given the current state of explainability methodologies, using the {SOTA} medical codes prediction system still requires the expertise and competencies of professional coders, even though its prediction accuracy is superior to that of human coders. This, we believe, is a very meaningful step toward developing explainable and accurate machine learning systems for fully autonomous medical code prediction from clinical notes.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models are currently the cornerstone of artificial intelligence in medical imaging. While progress is still being made, the generic technological core of convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) has had only modest innovations over the last several years, if at all. There is thus a need for improvement. More recently, transformer networks have emerged that replace convolutions with a complex attention mechanism, and they have already matched or exceeded the performance of {CNNs} in many tasks. Transformers need very large amounts of training data, even more than {CNNs}, but obtaining well-curated labeled data is expensive and difficult. A possible solution to this issue would be transfer learning with pretraining on a self-supervised task using very large amounts of unlabeled medical data. This pretrained network could then be fine-tuned on specific medical imaging tasks with relatively modest data requirements. The authors believe that the availability of a large-scale, three-dimension-capable, and extensively pretrained transformer model would be highly beneficial to the medical imaging and research community. In this article, authors discuss the challenges and obstacles of training a very large medical imaging transformer, including data needs, biases, training tasks, network architecture, privacy concerns, and computational requirements. The obstacles are substantial but not insurmountable for resourceful collaborative teams that may include academia and information technology industry partners. © {RSNA}, 2022 Keywords: Computer-aided Diagnosis ({CAD}), Informatics, Transfer Learning, Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}).},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

Watch: {MIT}’s Deep Learning State of the Art lecture referencing this post

In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud {TPU} offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.

The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A {TensorFlow} implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s {NLP} group created a guide annotating the paper with {PyTorch} implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic:




A High-Level Look
Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.},

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from {DNA} sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the {DNA} sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

Among the 6 520 long-distance chromatin interactions, we identify 2 067 enhancers that interact with 1 619 promoters and enhance their expression. These enhancers exist in accessible chromatin regions and are associated with various histone modifications and polymerase {II} binding. The promoters with interacting enhancers are expressed at higher levels than those without interacting enhancers, and their expression levels are positively correlated with the number of interacting enhancers. Interestingly, interacting promoters are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We also find that chromosomes are organized into multiple levels of interacting domains. Our results define a global view of {EP} interactions and provide a data set to further understand mechanisms of enhancer targeting and long-range chromatin organization.

            Pathology diagnostics relies on the assessment of morphology by trained experts, which remains subjective and qualitative. Here we developed a framework for large-scale histomorphometry ({FLASH}) performing deep learning-based semantic segmentation and subsequent large-scale extraction of interpretable, quantitative, morphometric features in non-tumour kidney histology. We use two internal and three external, multi-centre cohorts to analyse over 1000 kidney biopsies and nephrectomies. By associating morphometric features with clinical parameters, we confirm previous concepts and reveal unexpected relations. We show that the extracted features are independent predictors of long-term clinical outcomes in {IgA}-nephropathy. We introduce single-structure morphometric analysis by applying techniques from single-cell transcriptomics, identifying distinct glomerular populations and morphometric phenotypes along a trajectory of disease progression. Our study provides a concept for Next-generation Morphometry ({NGM}), enabling comprehensive quantitative pathology data mining, i.e., pathomics.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many {NLP} tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current {NLP} systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that {GPT}-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of {GPT}-3 in general.},

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

Large-scale biomedical data generation offers a unique opportunity to assess the effect and impact of cellular heterogeneity and environmental perturbations on the observed phenotype. Marrying the two, network medicine with biomedical data provides a framework to build meaningful models and extract impactful results at a network level. In this review, we survey existing network types and biomedical data sources. More importantly, we delve into ways in which the network medicine approach, aided by phenotype-specific biomedical data, can be gainfully applied. We provide three paradigms, mainly dealing with three major biological network archetypes: protein-protein interaction, expression-based, and gene regulatory networks. For each of these paradigms, we discuss a broad overview of philosophies under which various network methods work. We also provide a few examples in each paradigm as a test case of its successful application. Finally, we delineate several opportunities and challenges in the field of network medicine. We hope this review provides a lexicon for researchers from biological sciences and network theory to come on the same page to work on research areas that require interdisciplinary expertise. Taken together, the understanding gained from combining biomedical data with networks can be useful for characterizing disease etiologies and identifying therapeutic targets, which, in turn, will lead to better preventive medicine with translational impact on personalized healthcare.},

	abstract = {Data analytics is routinely used to support biomedical research in all areas, with particular focus on the most relevant clinical conditions, such as cancer. Bioinformatics approaches, in particular, have been used to characterize the molecular aspects of diseases. In recent years, numerous studies have been performed on cancer based upon single and multi-omics data. For example, Single-omics-based studies have employed a diverse set of data, such as gene expression, {DNA} methylation, or {miRNA}, to name only a few instances. Despite that, a significant part of literature reports studies on gene expression with microarray datasets. Single-omics data have high numbers of attributes and very low sample counts. This characteristic makes them paradigmatic of an under-sampled, small-n large-p machine learning problem. An important goal of single-omics data analysis is to find the most relevant genes, in terms of their potential use in clinics and research, in the batch of available data. This problem has been addressed in gene selection as one of the pre-processing steps in data mining. An analysis that use only one type of data (single-omics) often miss the complexity of the landscape of molecular phenomena underlying the disease. As a result, they provide limited and sometimes poorly reliable information about the disease mechanisms. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have been eager to build models that are more complex, obtaining more reliable results using multi-omics data. However, to achieve this, the most important challenge is data integration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges in single and multi-omics data analysis of cancer data, focusing on gene selection and data integration methods.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This work aims to provide a review of the existing literature in the field of automated machine learning ({AutoML}) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models "off-the-shelf" with limited data science expertise. We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using {AutoML} in healthcare, as well as existing applications of {AutoML} in healthcare.
{METHODS}: Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of {AutoML} from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of {AutoML} challenges hosted by {ChaLearn}.
{RESULTS}: A review of 101 papers in the field of {AutoML} revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of {AutoML} at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets.
{DISCUSSION}: The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning ({AutoML}) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset.
{CONCLUSION}: While there have already been some use cases of {AutoML} in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of {AutoML} in healthcare.},

Public involvement has been acknowledged as a key priority for prominent human genomics research initiatives in many different countries. However, to date, there has been no detailed analysis or review of the features, methods, and impacts of public involvement occurring in human genomics research projects worldwide. Here, we review the reported public involvement in 96 human genomics projects (initiatives), based on a database of initiatives hosted by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, according to information reported on public domain websites. To conduct the scoping review, we applied a structured categorization of criteria to all information extracted from the search. We found that only a third of all initiatives reported public involvement in any capacity (32/96, 33\%). In those reporting public involvement, we found considerable variation in both the methods and tasks of involvement. Some noteworthy initiatives reported diverse and comprehensive ways of involving the public, occurring through different stages of the research project cycle. Three notable initiatives reported a total of eight distinct impacts as a result of involving people. Our findings suggest there would be intrinsic value in having more public involvement occur in human genomics research worldwide. We also suggest that more systematic ways of reporting and evaluating involvement would be highly beneficial, to help develop best practices.},

Such models must handle the wide heterogeneity of individuals in both their genetic predisposition and their social and environmental determinants. Computational approaches to medicine need to be able to efficiently manage, visualize and integrate, large datasets combining structure, and unstructured formats. This needs to be done while constrained by different levels of confidentiality, ideally doing so within a unified analytical architecture. Efficient data integration and management is key to the successful application of computational intelligence approaches to medicine.

In oncology, massive amounts of data are being generated, ranging from molecular, histopathology, radiology to clinical records. The introduction of deep learning has greatly advanced the analysis of biomedical data. However, most approaches focus on single data modalities, leading to slow progress in methods to integrate complementary data types. Development of effective multimodal fusion approaches is becoming increasingly important as a single modality might not be consistent and sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of complex diseases to tailor medical care and improve personalized medicine. Many initiatives now focus on integrating these disparate modalities to unravel the biological processes involved in multifactorial diseases such as cancer. However, many obstacles remain, including lack of usable data as well as methods for clinical validation and interpretation. Here, we cover these current challenges and reflect on opportunities through deep learning to tackle data sparsity and scarcity, multimodal interpretability and standardization of datasets.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Over the last century, disruptive incidents in the fields of clinical and biomedical research have yielded a tremendous change in health data management systems. This is due to a number of breakthroughs in the medical field and the need for big data analytics and the Internet of Things ({IoT}) to be incorporated in a real-time smart health information management system. In addition, the requirements of patient care have evolved over time, allowing for more accurate prognoses and diagnoses. In this paper, we discuss the temporal evolution of health data management systems and capture the requirements that led to the development of a given system over a certain period of time. Consequently, we provide insights into those systems and give suggestions and research directions on how they can be improved for a better health care system.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study aimed to show that there is a need for a secure and efficient health data management system that will allow physicians and patients to update decentralized medical records and to analyze the medical data for supporting more precise diagnoses, prognoses, and public insights. Limitations of existing health data management systems were analyzed.
{METHODS}: To study the evolution and requirements of health data management systems over the years, a search was conducted to obtain research articles and information on medical lawsuits, health regulations, and acts. These materials were obtained from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Association for Computing Machinery, Elsevier, {MEDLINE}, {PubMed}, Scopus, and Web of Science databases.
{RESULTS}: Health data management systems have undergone a disruptive transformation over the years from paper to computer, web, cloud, {IoT}, big data analytics, and finally to blockchain. The requirements of a health data management system revealed from the evolving definitions of medical records and their management are (1) medical record data, (2) real-time data access, (3) patient participation, (4) data sharing, (5) data security, (6) patient identity privacy, and (7) public insights. This paper reviewed health data management systems based on these 7 requirements across studies conducted over the years. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the temporal evolution of health data management systems giving insights into the system requirements for better health care.
{CONCLUSIONS}: There is a need for a comprehensive real-time health data management system that allows physicians, patients, and external users to input their medical and lifestyle data into the system. The incorporation of big data analytics will aid in better prognosis or diagnosis of the diseases and the prediction of diseases. The prediction results will help in the development of an effective prevention plan.},

Acknowledged with the Nobel prize in 2014, numerous {SRM} methods have meanwhile evolved and are being widely applied in biomedical research, all with specific strengths and shortcomings. While some techniques are capable of nanometre-scale molecular resolution, others are geared towards volumetric three-dimensional multi-colour or fast live-cell imaging. In this editorial review, we pick on the latest trends in the field. We start with a brief historical overview of both conceptual and commercial developments. Next, we highlight important parameters for imaging successfully with a particular super-resolution modality.

	abstract = {Purpose
This paper reviews the research literature on electronic health record ({EHR}) systems. The aim is to find out (1) how electronic health records are defined, (2) how the structure of these records is described, (3) in what contexts {EHRs} are used, (4) who has access to {EHRs}, (5) which data components of the {EHRs} are used and studied, (6) what is the purpose of research in this field, (7) what methods of data collection have been used in the studies reviewed and (8) what are the results of these studies.
Methods
A systematic review was carried out of the research dealing with the content of {EHRs}. A literature search was conducted on four electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Cinalh, Eval and Cochrane.
Results
The concept of {EHR} comprised a wide range of information systems, from files compiled in single departments to longitudinal collections of patient data. Only very few papers offered descriptions of the structure of {EHRs} or the terminologies used. {EHRs} were used in primary, secondary and tertiary care. Data were recorded in {EHRs} by different groups of health care professionals. Secretarial staff also recorded data from dictation or nurses’ or physicians’ manual notes. Some information was also recorded by patients themselves; this information is validated by physicians. It is important that the needs and requirements of different users are taken into account in the future development of information systems. Several data components were documented in {EHRs}: daily charting, medication administration, physical assessment, admission nursing note, nursing care plan, referral, present complaint (e.g. symptoms), past medical history, life style, physical examination, diagnoses, tests, procedures, treatment, medication, discharge, history, diaries, problems, findings and immunization. In the future it will be necessary to incorporate different kinds of standardized instruments, electronic interviews and nursing documentation systems in {EHR} systems. The aspects of information quality most often explored in the studies reviewed were the completeness and accuracy of different data components. It has been shown in several studies that the use of an information system was conducive to more complete and accurate documentation by health care professionals. The quality of information is particularly important in patient care, but {EHRs} also provide important information for secondary purposes, such as health policy planning.
Conclusion
Studies focusing on the content of {EHRs} are needed, especially studies of nursing documentation or patient self-documentation. One future research area is to compare the documentation of different health care professionals with the core information about {EHRs} which has been determined in national health projects. The challenge for ongoing national health record projects around the world is to take into account all the different types of {EHRs} and the needs and requirements of different health care professionals and consumers in the development of {EHRs}. A further challenge is the use of international terminologies in order to achieve semantic interoperability.},

              Design/methodology/approach
              – The authors have analysed a conspicuous corpus of industry and academia articles linked with Big Data to find commonalities among the topics they treated. The authors have also compiled a survey of existing definitions with a view of generating a more solid one that encompasses most of the work happening in the field.
            
            
              Findings
              – The main themes of Big Data are: information, technology, methods and impact. The authors propose a new definition for the term that reads as follows: “Big Data is the Information asset characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value.”
            
            
              Practical implications
              – The formal definition that is proposed can enable a more coherent development of the concept of Big Data, as it solely relies on the essential strands of current state-of-the-art and is coherent with the most popular definitions currently used.
            
            
              Originality/value

	abstract = {In modern-day medicine, medical imaging has undergone immense advancements and can capture several biomedical images from patients. In the wake of this, to assist medical specialists, these images can be used and trained in an intelligent system in order to aid the determination of the different diseases that can be identified from analyzing these images. Classification plays an important role in this regard; it enhances the grouping of these images into categories of diseases and optimizes the next step of a computer-aided diagnosis system. The concept of classification in machine learning deals with the problem of identifying to which set of categories a new population belongs. When category membership is known, the classification is done on the basis of a training set of data containing observations. The goal of this paper is to perform a survey of classification algorithms for biomedical images. The paper then describes how these algorithms can be applied to a big data architecture by using the Spark framework. This paper further proposes the classification workflow based on the observed optimal algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning as drawn from the literature. The algorithm for the feature extraction step during the classification process is presented and can be customized in all other steps of the proposed classification workflow.},

The lack of a formal definition has led research to evolve into multiple and inconsistent paths.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2306.07303},
	abstract = {Transformer is a deep neural network that employs a self-attention mechanism to comprehend the contextual relationships within sequential data. Unlike conventional neural networks or updated versions of Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}) such as Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}), transformer models excel in handling long dependencies between input sequence elements and enable parallel processing. As a result, transformer-based models have attracted substantial interest among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. This can be attributed to their immense potential and remarkable achievements, not only in Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) tasks but also in a wide range of domains, including computer vision, audio and speech processing, healthcare, and the Internet of Things ({IoT}). Although several survey papers have been published highlighting the transformer's contributions in specific fields, architectural differences, or performance evaluations, there is still a significant absence of a comprehensive survey paper encompassing its major applications across various domains. Therefore, we undertook the task of filling this gap by conducting an extensive survey of proposed transformer models from 2017 to 2022. Our survey encompasses the identification of the top five application domains for transformer-based models, namely: {NLP}, Computer Vision, Multi-Modality, Audio and Speech Processing, and Signal Processing. We analyze the impact of highly influential transformer-based models in these domains and subsequently classify them based on their respective tasks using a proposed taxonomy. Our aim is to shed light on the existing potential and future possibilities of transformers for enthusiastic researchers, thus contributing to the broader understanding of this groundbreaking technology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Congenital muscular dystrophies ({CMDs}) and congenital myopathies ({CMs}) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous degenerative primary muscle disorders with onset at birth or during infancy. Due to vast heterogeneity, clinical examination and protein-based analyses often fail to identify the genetic causes of these diseases. The aim of this study was to genetically diagnose a cohort of 36 difficult-to-diagnose {CMD} and {CM} cases of Indian origin using next-generation sequencing methods.
{METHODS}: Whole-exome sequencing ({WES}) was performed to identify pathogenic mutations in previously reported {CMD} and {CM}-related genes using variant calling and stringent variant filtration process. Subsequently, in silico homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations ({MDS}) studies were undertaken for a number of novel and missense variants.
{RESULTS}: A total of 33 and 21 rare and deleterious mutations were identified in 28 genes previously reported in {CMD} and {CM} based on {OMIM}, {ClinVar} and Orphanet, respectively. We could accurately diagnose 54\% patients (n = 12/22) in the {CMD} group and 35\% patients (n = 5/14) in the {CM} group. Furthermore, {MDS} studies for mutations located in {LMNA}, {LAMA}2 and {RYR}1 suggest that the wild-type proteins are more stable than their mutant counterparts, implying a potential mechanism of pathogenesis.
{CONCLUSION}: The {WES} findings led us to identify reported as well as novel variants for the first time in Indian patients with {CMD} and {CM}. This allowed us to achieve an accurate genetic diagnosis, which was difficult using conventional diagnostic tools. Transferring these {WES} findings to clinical practice will help guide clinical care of the affected patients and inform genetic counselling.},

The International Standard of Care Committee for Congenital Myopathies performed a literature review and consulted a group of experts in the field to develop a summary of (1) the key features common to all forms of congenital myopathy and (2) the specific features that help to discriminate between the different genetic subtypes. The consensus statement was refined by two rounds of on-line survey, and a three-day workshop. This consensus statement provides guidelines to the physician assessing the infant or child with hypotonia and weakness. We summarise the clinical features that are most suggestive of a congenital myopathy, the major differential diagnoses and the features on clinical examination, investigations, muscle pathology and muscle imaging that are suggestive of a specific genetic diagnosis to assist in prioritisation of genetic testing of known genes. As next generation sequencing becomes increasingly used as a diagnostic tool in clinical practise, these guidelines will assist in determining which sequence variations are likely to be pathogenic.},

Unlike encoders from prior work that are more specialized, {INSTRUCTOR} is a single embedder that can generate text embeddings tailored to different downstream tasks and domains, without any further training. We first annotate instructions for 330 diverse tasks and train {INSTRUCTOR} on this multitask mixture with a contrastive loss. We evaluate {INSTRUCTOR} on 70 embedding evaluation tasks (66 of which are unseen during training), ranging from classification and information retrieval to semantic textual similarity and text generation evaluation. {INSTRUCTOR}, while having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the previous best model, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average improvement of 3.4\% compared to the previous best results on the 70 diverse datasets. Our analysis suggests that {INSTRUCTOR} is robust to changes in instructions, and that instruction finetuning mitigates the challenge of training a single model on diverse datasets. Our model, code, and data are available at https://instructor-embedding.github.io.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

Changing to 10\% {CO}2/90\% 02 on both surfaces doubles the acid secretory rate. We calculate that, were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation, the tissue would now be oxygen limited. This prediction is tested by raising the P02 by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. Since no change in acid secretory rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from {PO}2 = 0.9 to {PO}2 = 1.9 atm, we conclude that the tissue is not O2 limited at normal pressure. Decreasing {PO}2 below 0.9 atm, by contrast, decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both {PD} and resistance. We infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient {CO}2.},

Many useful tools/packages (e.g. scikit-learn) have been developed to make the various elements of data handling, processing, modeling, and interpretation accessible. However, it is not trivial for most investigators to assemble these elements into a rigorous, replicatable, unbiased, and effective data analysis pipeline. Automated machine learning ({AutoML}) seeks to address these issues by simplifying the process of {ML} analysis for all. Here, we introduce {STREAMLINE}, a simple, transparent, end-to-end {AutoML} pipeline designed as a framework to easily conduct rigorous {ML} modeling and analysis (limited initially to binary classification). {STREAMLINE} is specifically designed to compare performance between datasets, {ML} algorithms, and other {AutoML} tools. It is unique among other {autoML} tools by offering a fully transparent and consistent baseline of comparison using a carefully designed series of pipeline elements including (1) exploratory analysis, (2) basic data cleaning, (3) cross validation partitioning, (4) data scaling and imputation, (5) filter-based feature importance estimation, (6) collective feature selection, (7) {ML} modeling with ‘Optuna’ hyperparameter optimization across 15 established algorithms (including less well-known Genetic Programming and rule-based {ML}), (8) evaluation across 16 classification metrics, (9) model feature importance estimation, (10) statistical significance comparisons, and (11) automatically exporting all results, plots, a {PDF} summary report, and models that can be easily applied to replication data.},

On dénombre environ 6 000 maladies rares dont 80 \% sont d’origine génétique. En Europe, une maladie est dite rare lorsqu’elle touche moins d’1 personne sur 2 000. Chez l’enfant comme chez l’adulte, de nombreuses maladies rares ont une composante neurologique. Orphanet est un portail en libre accès sur internet, sans but lucratif, officiellement soutenu par le Ministère de la Santé Français et la Commission Européenne. Il a pour mission d’informer les professionnels de santé et les patients afin de contribuer à améliorer le diagnostic tout en favorisant une meilleure prise en charge et un meilleur traitement des maladies rares. Le site propose de nombreux services dont un inventaire et une encyclopédie des maladies rares avec les gènes associés (parmi ces maladies, plus de 2 000 avec des manifestations neurologiques sont répertoriées) ; une aide au diagnostic ; des recommandations cliniques et d’urgence ; un répertoire de tests diagnostiques ; un inventaire des médicaments orphelins ; les projets de recherche en cours dont les essais cliniques ; les centres de référence et de compétences. Le réseau Orphanet, coordonné par l’{US}14 de l’{INSERM}, collecte à ce jour les ressources expertes pour les maladies rares dans 37 pays dont les 27 états membres de la Communauté Européenne.
There are approximately 6000 rare diseases, and 80\% of them are genetic. In Europe, a disease is considered rare when it affects no more than one person in 2000. In France, two to three million people are affected, while nearly 30 million others are affected across Europe (5–8\% of the whole European population). The majority of rare diseases are poorly understood by health professionals. Due to the lack of sufficient scientific and medical knowledge, many patients are misdiagnosed, which results in delays in care that can be harmful. Because many rare diseases are often associated with neurological manifestations, the neurologist in his daily practice may often encounter these complex diseases that require special care as well as a multidisciplinary approach. Orphanet is the reference portal for rare diseases. Freely accessible on the Internet, it is a non-profit service officially supported by the French Ministry of Health and the European Commission. Its mission is to keep healthcare professionals and patients informed and, by so doing, it contributes to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. It is currently the only project that establishes a link between diseases and any published information concerning them, and the appropriate services for patients as well as healthcare professionals. Orphanet is currently the most comprehensive site in terms of referenced and documented data, and it has in just a few years become the global reference portal for rare diseases and orphan drugs for all audiences. Orphanet generates a million page views per month. The site is available in six languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Portuguese) and offers a range of services, including: an inventory, classification and peer-reviewed encyclopedia of rare diseases along with the associated genes (more than 2000 diseases with neurological manifestations are described); a diagnostic support tool; clinical and emergency guidelines; a directory of specialised services in 37 partner countries; an encyclopedia aimed at the general public; an inventory of orphan drugs; downloadable thematic studies and reports on such subjects as the prevalence of rare diseases, orphan drugs, aids and services for patients; and numerous links to other sources of information. Five to ten new rare diseases are described every month, which represents a major challenge for health professionals in terms of keeping their knowledge up to date. The Orph anet website content is expert-validated and updated continuously to respond in real time.},

However, to date {LCSs} remain poorly recognized and thus rarely considered for comparison to other {ML} approaches in or outside of the {EC} community. One likely reason for this is the general lack of easy-to-use {LCS} implementations to facilitate comparisons to other well-known {ML} approaches. The Python-based scikit-learn library has become a very popular way to implement, utilize, and compare {ML} algorithms in a simple, uniform manner. In this work, we develop and evaluate the first {LCS} scikit-learn package, called scikit-{eLCS}. The scikit-{eLCS} algorithm is a modern Michigan-style supervised-learning {LCS} descended from {eLCS}, {UCS}, and {XCS}. We demonstrate the efficacy and capabilities of this package over benchmark n-bit multiplexer problems. We expect scikit-{eLCS} to serve as an algorithmic benchmark to facilitate future {ML} comparisons, as well as a blueprint for the implementation of other scikit-learn compatible {LCS} algorithms.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized research and diagnosis in the field of rare Mendelian disorders, notably via whole-exome sequencing ({WES}). However, one of the main issues hampering achievement of a diagnosis via {WES} analyses is the extended list of variants of unknown significance ({VUS}), mostly composed of missense variants. Hence, improved solutions are needed to address the challenges of identifying potentially deleterious variants and ranking them in a prioritized short list. We present {MISTIC} ({MISsense} {deleTeriousness} {predICtor}), a new prediction tool based on an original combination of two complementary machine learning algorithms using a soft voting system that integrates 113 missense features, ranging from multi-ethnic minor allele frequencies and evolutionary conservation, to physiochemical and biochemical properties of amino acids. Our approach also uses training sets with a wide spectrum of variant profiles, including both high-confidence positive (deleterious) and negative (benign) variants. Compared to recent state-of-the-art prediction tools in various benchmark tests and independent evaluation scenarios, {MISTIC} exhibits the best and most consistent performance, notably with the highest {AUC} value ({\textgreater} 0.95). Importantly, {MISTIC} maintains its high performance in the specific case of discriminating deleterious variants from benign variants that are rare or population-specific. In a clinical context, {MISTIC} drastically reduces the list of {VUS} ({\textless}30\%) and significantly improves the ranking of "causative" deleterious variants. Pre-computed {MISTIC} scores for all possible human missense variants are available at http://lbgi.fr/mistic.},

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of {CNN}-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-{CAM}), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-{CAM} is applicable to a wide variety of {CNN} model-families: (1) {CNNs} with fully-connected layers, (2) {CNNs} used for structured outputs, (3) {CNNs} used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-{CAM} with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering ({VQA}) models, including {ResNet}-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and {VQA}, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-{CAM} and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-{CAM} helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-{CAM} helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

	abstract = {Objective Genetic diagnosis of muscular dystrophies ({MDs}) has classically been guided by clinical presentation, muscle biopsy, and muscle {MRI} data. Muscle {MRI} suggests diagnosis based on the pattern of muscle fatty replacement. However, patterns overlap between different disorders and knowledge about disease-specific patterns is limited. Our aim was to develop a software-based tool that can recognize muscle {MRI} patterns and thus aid diagnosis of {MDs}.
Methods We collected 976 pelvic and lower limbs T1-weighted muscle {MRIs} from 10 different {MDs}. Fatty replacement was quantified using Mercuri score and files containing the numeric data were generated. Random forest supervised machine learning was applied to develop a model useful to identify the correct diagnosis. Two thousand different models were generated and the one with highest accuracy was selected. A new set of 20 {MRIs} was used to test the accuracy of the model, and the results were compared with diagnoses proposed by 4 specialists in the field.
Results A total of 976 lower limbs {MRIs} from 10 different {MDs} were used. The best model obtained had 95.7\% accuracy, with 92.1\% sensitivity and 99.4\% specificity. When compared with experts on the field, the diagnostic accuracy of the model generated was significantly higher in a new set of 20 {MRIs}.
Conclusion Machine learning can help doctors in the diagnosis of muscle dystrophies by analyzing patterns of muscle fatty replacement in muscle {MRI}. This tool can be helpful in daily clinics and in the interpretation of the results of next-generation sequencing tests.
Classification of evidence This study provides Class {II} evidence that a muscle {MRI}-based artificial intelligence tool accurately diagnoses muscular dystrophies.},

	abstract = {The technological progress in digitalization of complete histological glass slides has opened a new door in tissue--based diagnosis. The presentation of microscopic images as a whole in a digital matrix is called virtual slide. A virtual slide allows calculation and related presentation of image information that otherwise can only be seen by individual human performance. The digital world permits attachments of several (if not all) fields of view and the contemporary visualization on a screen. The presentation of all microscopic magnifications is possible if the basic pixel resolution is less than 0.25 microns. To introduce digital tissue--based diagnosis into the daily routine work of a surgical pathologist requires a new setup of workflow arrangement and procedures. The quality of digitized images is sufficient for diagnostic purposes; however, the time needed for viewing virtual slides exceeds that of viewing original glass slides by far. The reason lies in a slower and more difficult sampling procedure, which is the selection of information containing fields of view. By application of artificial intelligence, tissue--based diagnosis in routine work can be managed automatically in steps as follows: 1. The individual image quality has to be measured, and corrected, if necessary. 2. A diagnostic algorithm has to be applied. An algorithm has be developed, that includes both object based (object features, structures) and pixel based (texture) measures. 3. These measures serve for diagnosis classification and feedback to order additional information, for example in virtual immunohistochemical slides. 4. The measures can serve for automated image classification and detection of relevant image information by themselves without any labeling. 5. The pathologists' duty will not be released by such a system; to the contrary, it will manage and supervise the system, i.e., just working at a "higher level". Virtual slides are already in use for teaching and continuous education in anatomy and pathology. First attempts to introduce them into routine work have been reported. Application of {AI} has been established by automated immunohistochemical measurement systems ({EAMUS}, www.{diagnomX}.eu). The performance of automated diagnosis has been reported for a broad variety of organs at sensitivity and specificity levels {\textgreater}85\%). The implementation of a complete connected {AI} supported system is in its childhood. Application of {AI} in digital tissue--based diagnosis will allow the pathologists to work as supervisors and no longer as primary "water carriers". Its accurate use will give them the time needed to concentrating on difficult cases for the benefit of their patients.},

Such processes induce multimodality in patient data by linking image data to free-text data and consequently, multimodal data have become central to drive research and improve diagnosis of patients. However, the exploitation of patient data is challenging as the ecosystem of available analysis tools is fragmented depending on the type of data (images, text, genetic sequences), the task to be performed (digitization, processing, exploration) and the domain of interest (clinical phenotype, histology...). To address the challenges, the analysis tools need to be integrated in a simple, comprehensive, and flexible platform. Here, we present {IMPatienT} (Integrated digital Multimodal {PATIENt} {daTa}), a free and open-source web application to digitize, process and explore multimodal patient data. {IMPatienT} has a modular architecture, including four components to: (i) create a standard vocabulary for a domain, (ii) digitize and process free-text data by mapping it to a set of standard terms, (iii) annotate images and perform image segmentation, and (iv) generate an automatic visualization dashboard to provide insight on the data and perform automatic diagnosis suggestions. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of {IMPatienT} on a corpus of 40 simulated muscle biopsy reports of congenital myopathy patients. {IMPatienT} is a platform to digitize, process and explore patient data that can handle image and free-text data. As it relies on a user-designed vocabulary, it can be adapted to fit any domain of research and can be used as a patient registry for exploratory data analysis ({EDA}).

While semantic segmentation algorithms enable image analysis and quantification in many applications, the design of respective specialized solutions is non-trivial and highly dependent on dataset properties and hardware conditions. We developed {nnU}-Net, a deep learning-based segmentation method that automatically configures itself, including preprocessing, network architecture, training and post-processing for any new task. The key design choices in this process are modeled as a set of fixed parameters, interdependent rules and empirical decisions. Without manual intervention, {nnU}-Net surpasses most existing approaches, including highly specialized solutions on 23 public datasets used in international biomedical segmentation competitions. We make {nnU}-Net publicly available as an out-of-the-box tool, rendering state-of-the-art segmentation accessible to a broad audience by requiring neither expert knowledge nor computing resources beyond standard network training.},

                In the era of “big data,” science is increasingly information driven, and the potential for computers to store, manage, and integrate massive amounts of data has given rise to such new disciplinary fields as biomedical informatics. Applied ontology offers a strategy for the organization of scientific information in computer-tractable form, drawing on concepts not only from computer and information science but also from linguistics, logic, and philosophy. This book provides an introduction to the field of applied ontology that is of particular relevance to biomedicine, covering theoretical components of ontologies, best practices for ontology design, and examples of biomedical ontologies in use.After defining an ontology as a representation of the types of entities in a given domain, the book distinguishes between different kinds of ontologies and taxonomies, and shows how applied ontology draws on more traditional ideas from metaphysics. It presents the core features of the Basic Formal Ontology ({BFO}), now used by over one hundred ontology projects around the world, and offers examples of domain ontologies that utilize {BFO}. The book also describes Web Ontology Language ({OWL}), a common framework for Semantic Web technologies. Throughout, the book provides concrete recommendations for the design and construction of domain ontologies.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

After initial bioinformatic data processing, the interactive analysis of genome, exome, and panel sequencing data typically starts from lists of genetic variants in {VCF} format. Medical geneticists filter and annotate these lists to identify variants that may be relevant for the disease under investigation, or to select variants that are reported in a clinical diagnostics setting. We developed {VCF}.Filter to facilitate the search for disease-linked variants, providing a standalone Java program with a user-friendly interface for interactive variant filtering and annotation. {VCF}.Filter allows the user to define a broad range of filtering criteria through a graphical interface. Common workflows such as trio analysis and cohort-based filtering are pre-configured, and more complex analyses can be performed using {VCF}.Filter's support for custom annotations and filtering criteria. All filtering is documented in the results file, thus providing traceability of the interactive variant prioritization. {VCF}.Filter is an open source tool that is freely and openly available at http://vcffilter.rarediseases.at.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a major neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia. Currently, no treatment exists to slow down or stop the progression of {AD}. There is converging belief that disease-modifying treatments should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, the mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) and preclinical stages. Making a diagnosis of {AD} and offering a prognosis (likelihood of converting to {AD}) at these early stages are challenging tasks but possible with the help of multimodality imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG})-positron emission topography ({PET}), amyloid-{PET}, and recently introduced tau-{PET}, which provides different but complementary information. This article is a focused review of existing research in the recent decade that used statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data for diagnosis and prognosis of {AD} at the {MCI} or preclinical stages. We review the existing work in 3 subareas: diagnosis, prognosis, and methods for handling modality-wise missing data-a commonly encountered problem when using multimodality imaging for prediction or classification. Factors contributing to missing data include lack of imaging equipment, cost, difficulty of obtaining patient consent, and patient drop-off (in longitudinal studies). Finally, we summarize our major findings and provide some recommendations for potential future research directions.},

To address these challenges, the {RD}-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform ({GPAP}) facilitates the collation, discovery, sharing, and analysis of standardized genome-phenome data within a collaborative environment. Authorized clinicians and researchers submit pseudonymised phenotypic profiles encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology, and raw genomic data which is processed through a standardized pipeline. After an optional embargo period, the data are shared with other platform users, with the objective that similar cases in the system and queries from peers may help diagnose the case. Additionally, the platform enables bidirectional discovery of similar cases in other databases from the Matchmaker Exchange network. To facilitate genome-phenome analysis and interpretation by clinical researchers, the {RD}-Connect {GPAP} provides a powerful user-friendly interface and leverages tens of information sources. As a result, the resource has already helped diagnose hundreds of rare disease patients and discover new disease causing genes.},

	doi = {10.1055/s-0037-1620263},
	abstract = {Background and Significance: The increased emphasis on patient satisfaction has coincided with the growing adoption of electronic health records ({EHRs}) throughout the U.S. The 2001 Institute of Medicine Report, “Crossing the Quality Chasm,” identified patient-centered care as a key element of quality health care.[1] In response to this call, the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ({HCAHPS}) survey was developed to assess patients' health care experiences in the inpatient setting. Simultaneously, financial incentives have facilitated the rapid adoption of {EHR} applications, with 84\% of hospitals maintaining at least a basic {EHR} in 2015 (a ninefold increase since 2008).[2]
Despite the concurrent deployment of patient satisfaction surveys and {EHRs}, there is a poor understanding of the relationship that may exist between physician usage of the {EHR} and patient satisfaction. Most prior research into the impact of the {EHR} on physician–patient communication has been observational, describing the behaviors of physicians and patients when the clinician accesses an {EHR} in the exam room. Past research has shown that encounters where physicians access the {EHR} are often filled with long pauses,[3] and that few clinicians attempt to engage patients by sharing what they are looking at on the screen.[4] A recent meta-analysis reviewing 53 papers found that only 7 studies attempted to correlate objective observations of physician communication behaviors with patient perceptions by eliciting feedback from the patients.[5] No study used a standardized assessment tool of patient satisfaction. The authors conclude that additional work is necessary to better understand the patient perspective of the presence of an {EHR} during a clinical encounter.
Additionally, increasing {EHR} adoption and emphasis on patient satisfaction have also corresponded with rising physician burnout rates.[6] [7] Prior work suggests that {EHR} adoption may be contributing to this trend.[8] Burnout from the {EHR} may be due in part to the significant amount of time physicians spend logged into systems, documenting long after clinic has ended in effort to avoid disrupting the patient–physician relationship.[9]
We used existing data sources to describe the relationship between the amount of time physicians spend logged in to the {EHR}—both during daytime hours as well after clinic hours—and performance on a validated patient satisfaction survey. Our null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between increased time logged in to the {EHR} and patient satisfaction.},

Here, we present recent major extensions of the {HPO} for neurology, nephrology, immunology, pulmonology, newborn screening, and other areas. For example, the seizure subontology now reflects the International League Against Epilepsy ({ILAE}) guidelines and these enhancements have already shown clinical validity. We present new efforts to harmonize computational definitions of phenotypic abnormalities across the {HPO} and multiple phenotype ontologies used for animal models of disease. These efforts will benefit software such as Exomiser by improving the accuracy and scope of cross-species phenotype matching. The computational modeling strategy used by the {HPO} to define disease entities and phenotypic features and distinguish between them is explained in detail.We also report on recent efforts to translate the {HPO} into indigenous languages.

	abstract = {Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) finding parameter-efficient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach ({StarDist}-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.},

	abstract = {Large-scale image data such as digital whole-slide histology images pose a challenging task at annotation software solutions. Today, a number of good solutions with varying scopes exist. For cell annotation, however, we find that many do not match the prerequisites for fast annotations. Especially in the field of mitosis detection, it is assumed that detection accuracy could significantly benefit from larger annotation databases that are currently however very troublesome to produce. Further, multiple independent (blind) expert labels are a big asset for such databases, yet there is currently no tool for this kind of annotation available. To ease this tedious process of expert annotation and grading, we introduce {SlideRunner}, an open source annotation and visualization tool for digital histopathology, developed in close cooperation with two pathologists. {SlideRunner} is capable of setting annotations like object centers (for e.g. cells) as well as object boundaries (e.g. for tumor outlines). It provides single-click annotations as well as a blind mode for multi-annotations, where the expert is directly shown the microscopy image containing the cells that he has not yet rated.},

	abstract = {Feature selection plays a critical role in biomedical data mining, driven by increasing feature dimensionality in target problems and growing interest in advanced but computationally expensive methodologies able to model complex associations. Specifically, there is a need for feature selection methods that are computationally efficient, yet sensitive to complex patterns of association, e.g. interactions, so that informative features are not mistakenly eliminated prior to downstream modeling. This paper focuses on Relief-based algorithms ({RBAs}), a unique family of filter-style feature selection algorithms that have gained appeal by striking an effective balance between these objectives while flexibly adapting to various data characteristics, e.g. classification vs. regression. First, this work broadly examines types of feature selection and defines {RBAs} within that context. Next, we introduce the original Relief algorithm and associated concepts, emphasizing the intuition behind how it works, how feature weights generated by the algorithm can be interpreted, and why it is sensitive to feature interactions without evaluating combinations of features. Lastly, we include an expansive review of {RBA} methodological research beyond Relief and its popular descendant, {ReliefF}. In particular, we characterize branches of {RBA} research, and provide comparative summaries of {RBA} algorithms including contributions, strategies, functionality, time complexity, adaptation to key data characteristics, and software availability.},

	doi = {10.12688/f1000research.16422.1},
	abstract = {By definition, congenital myopathy typically presents with skeletal muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth. Traditionally, congenital myopathy subtypes have been predominantly distinguished on the basis of the pathological hallmarks present on skeletal muscle biopsies. Many genes cause congenital myopathies when mutated, and a burst of new causative genes have been identified because of advances in gene sequencing technology. Recent discoveries include extending the disease phenotypes associated with previously identified genes and determining that genes formerly known to cause only dominant disease can also cause recessive disease. The more recently identified congenital myopathy genes account for only a small proportion of patients. Thus, the congenital myopathy genes remaining to be discovered are predicted to be extremely rare causes of disease, which greatly hampers their identification. Significant progress in the provision of molecular diagnoses brings important information and value to patients and their families, such as possible disease prognosis, better disease management, and informed reproductive choice, including carrier screening of parents. Additionally, from accurate genetic knowledge, rational treatment options can be hypothesised and subsequently evaluated in vitro and in animal models. A wide range of potential congenital myopathy therapies have been investigated on the basis of improved understanding of disease pathomechanisms, and some therapies are in clinical trials. Although large hurdles remain, promise exists for translating treatment benefits from preclinical models to patients with congenital myopathy, including harnessing proven successes for other genetic diseases.},

Rare variant ‘bins’ ({RVBs}) hold the potential to increase association detection power. However, previously proposed binning approaches relied on priorknowledge assumptions, instead of data-driven techniques, and ignored the potential for multivariate interactions. We present the Relevant Association Rare-variant-bin Evolver ({RARE}), the first evolutionary algorithm for automatically constructing and evaluating {RVBs} with either univariate or epistatic associations. We evaluate {RARE}’s ability to correctly bin simulated rare-variant associations over a variety of algorithmic and dataset scenarios. Specifically, we examine (1) ability to detect {RVBs} of univariate effect (with or without noise), (2) using fixed vs. adaptable bins sizes, (3) employing expert knowledge to initialize bins, and (4) ability to detect {RVBs} interacting with a separate common variant. We present preliminary results demonstrating the feasibility, efficacy, and limitations of this proposed rare-variant feature engineering algorithm.},

This systematic review aims to identify and collate the findings of studies published between 1960 and 2013 on the prevalence of all types of muscular dystrophies.
{SUMMARY}: Relevant articles were identified through electronic database searches and manual searches of reference lists. There were 38 articles from across 19 countries that met the inclusion criteria. The total combined prevalence for all muscular dystrophies for studies classified as having a low risk of bias ranged between 19.8 and 25.1 per 100,000 person-years. Myotonic dystrophy (0.5-18.1 per 100,000), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1.7-4.2) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (3.2-4.6 per 100,000) were found to be the most common types of disorder. There was wide variation in study methodology, case ascertainment, and verification procedures and populations studied, all of which may contribute to the wide prevalence range, in addition to the likely variation in prevalence by country. Key Messages: Greater consistency in the conduct and reporting of neuroepidemiological studies is urgently needed to enable comparisons to be made between studies, countries, and over time.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genetic myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Epidemiological studies of genetic myopathy have not yet been performed in Korea.
{OBJECTIVES}: This study used data from the national health insurance claims database to determine the prevalence and socioeconomic status of patients with genetic myopathy in Korea.
{METHODS}: We analyzed the Health Insurance Review and Assessment database from 2007 to 2011. Patients with genetic myopathy were defined based on diagnostic and procedure codes. We then evaluated the prevalence, types of health insurances, and medical expenses of these patients.
{RESULTS}: During the 11-year study period, 2,988 patients with genetic myopathy were enrolled. Among them, 1,762 were men and 1,226 were women. The prevalence per 100,000 population in 2017 was 3.09 (3.94 for men and 2.24 for women). The prevalence of genetic myopathy among men {\textless}35 years old (8.33 per 100,000 population) was approximately twice that among women {\textless}35 years old (4.06 per 100,000 population). However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of genetic myopathy among those ≥35 years old according to sex. The ratio of patients using medical aid among all genetic myopathy patients was approximately 4 times than that among the general population in Korea. The medical expenses per person for genetic myopathy increased from {USD} 2,027 in 2007 to {USD} 4,810 in 2017.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study was the first nationwide epidemiologic study of the prevalence and socioeconomic status of patients with genetic myopathy in Korea. Our results confirmed a sex divergence in a younger population and those with low socioeconomic status among patients with genetic myopathy.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Congenital myopathy as a nosologic entity has long been recognized, but knowledge of overall and subtype prevalence and phenotype-genotype relationship is scarce, especially in the adult population.
{METHODS}: A national cohort of 107 patients ≥5 years diagnosed with congenital myopathy were prospectively assessed clinically, histologically, and genetically.
{RESULTS}: Twenty-five patients were excluded because of atypical features or alternative etiologies. The remaining 82 were on average 28 years old. Histologic examination revealed 14 (17\%) with core disease, 15 (18\%) centronuclear myopathy, 12 (15\%) nemaline rods, 27 (33\%) congenital fiber-type disproportion or type I predominance, and 14 (17\%) nonspecific myopathic changes. Genetic etiology was identified in 46 patients (56.1\%); 22.0\% were heterozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in {RYR}1, 7.3\% had {DNM}2 mutations, and 7.3\% {NEB} mutations. Less than 5\% had mutations in {ACTA}1, {TPM}2/3, {MTM}1, {TTN}, {SEPN}1, or {SC}4NA. A genetic cause was established in 83\% with specific histology (cores/rods/centronuclear myopathy) vs 29\% with unspecific histology. The detailed clinical examination found gene-dependent discrepancies in the pattern of muscle affection and walking ability. Although walking ability was delayed in patients with {ACTA}1, {TPM}2/3, and {RYR}1 mutations, it was within normal limits in patients with {NEB} and {DNM}2 mutations.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We found that overall, genetic and histologic prevalence of congenital myopathy in Denmark differs from previous retrospective reports. Less {RYR}1 and more {DNM}2 and {NEB} mutations and less core histology were present in our cohort. These differences may be explained by our prospective design, the older cohort of patients, and by differences in genetic background.},

Maze problems have been widely used in {ALCS} literature, as they provide such environments. However, few {ALCS} can efficiently run in such mazes, having trouble to build a complete and accurate internal representation of their environment. {ALCS} can implement Probability-Enhanced Predictions ({PEP}) in their classifiers. Those {PEP} permit {ALCS} to handle non-deterministic environments, but they have never been experimented within {ACS}2 (Anticipatory Classifier System 2), yet one of the most advanced {ALCS}, and tested within a thorough maze benchmark. This paper introduces {PEPACS}, an {ALCS} that integrates {PEP} to {ACS}2. {PEPACS} integrates an aliasing detection algorithm that let the system build {PEP}-enhanced classifiers, and the learning process was adjusted so as to avoid over-generalization issues. The presented results show that {PEP} with {ACS}2 is a suitable approach to handle at least one kind of non-determinism (namely, the perceptual aliasing issue), without impairing {ACS}2 functionalities, and that {PEP} allows the system to build a complete and accurate internal representation of its environment.},

	abstract = {Clinical research and practice in the 21st century is poised to be transformed by analysis of computable electronic medical records and population-level genome-scale patient profiles. Genomic data capture genetic and environmental state, providing information on heterogeneity in disease and treatment outcome, but genomic-based clinical risk scores are limited. Achieving the goal of routine precision medicine that takes advantage of these rich genomics data will require computational methods that support heterogeneous data, have excellent predictive performance, and ideally, provide biologically interpretable results. Traditional machine-learning approaches excel at performance, but often have limited interpretability. Patient similarity networks are an emerging paradigm for precision medicine, in which patients are clustered or classified based on their similarities in various features, including genomic profiles. This strategy is analogous to standard medical diagnosis, has excellent performance, is interpretable, and can preserve patient privacy. We review new methods based on patient similarity networks, including Similarity Network Fusion for patient clustering and {netDx} for patient classification. While these methods are already useful, much work is required to improve their scalability for contemporary genetic cohorts, optimize parameters, and incorporate a wide range of genomics and clinical data. The coming 5 years will provide an opportunity to assess the utility of network-based algorithms for precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

It is within this context that we already developed the Biomolecular Network Ontology especially for the semantic understanding of the behaviour of complex biomolecular networks and their transittability. However, the challenge now is how to automatically populate it from a variety of biological documents. To this end, the target of this paper is to propose a new approach to automatically populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology and take advantage of the vast amount of biological knowledge expressed in heterogeneous unstructured data about complex biomolecular networks. Indeed, we have recently observed the emergence of deep learning techniques that provide significant and rapid progress in several domains, particularly in the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Despite its significant progress in recent years, deep learning is still not commonly used to populate ontologies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based {NLP} ontology population system to populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology. Its originality is to jointly exploit deep learning and natural language processing techniques to identify, extract and classify new instances referring to the {BNO} ontology’s concepts from textual data. The preliminary results highlight the efficiency of our proposal for ontology population.},

Following an overview of different imaging modalities, the present review will give a concise introduction to systematic image analysis and interpretation in genetic neuromuscular disorders. The pattern of selective muscle involvement will be presented in detail in conditions such as the congenital or myofibrillar myopathies where muscle imaging is particularly useful to inform the (differential) diagnosis, and in disorders such as Duchenne or fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy where the diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but where detailed knowledge of disease progression on the muscle imaging level may inform better understanding of the natural history. Utilizing the group of the congenital myopathies as an example, selected case studies will illustrate how muscle {MRI} can be used to inform the diagnostic process in the clinico-pathological context. Future developments, in particular, concerning the increasing use of whole-body {MRI} protocols and novel quantitative fat assessments techniques potentially relevant as an outcome measure, will be briefly outlined.},

However, current multimodal frameworks suffer from low sensitivity at high specificity levels, due to their limitations in learning correlations among highly heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we design a deep learning framework for cervical dysplasia diagnosis by leveraging multimodal information. We first employ the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) to convert the low-level image data into a feature vector fusible with other non-image modalities. We then jointly learn the non-linear correlations among all modalities in a deep neural network. Our multimodal framework is an end-to-end deep network which can learn better complementary features from the image and non-image modalities. It automatically gives the final diagnosis for cervical dysplasia with 87.83 \% sensitivity at 90 \% specificity on a large dataset, which significantly outperforms methods using any single source of information alone and previous multimodal frameworks.},

Thus, we use deep learning ({DL}) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI})), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs})), and clinical test data to classify patients into {AD}, {MCI}, and controls ({CN}). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative ({ADNI}) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and {meanF}1 scores. Our models have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ({RAVLT}) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with the known {AD} literature.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is a technique for recognizing patterns that can be applied to medical images. Although it is a powerful tool that can help in rendering medical diagnoses, it can be misapplied. Machine learning typically begins with the machine learning algorithm system computing the image features that are believed to be of importance in making the prediction or diagnosis of interest. The machine learning algorithm system then identifies the best combination of these image features for classifying the image or computing some metric for the given image region. There are several methods that can be used, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are open-source versions of most of these machine learning methods that make them easy to try and apply to images. Several metrics for measuring the performance of an algorithm exist; however, one must be aware of the possible associated pitfalls that can result in misleading metrics. More recently, deep learning has started to be used; this method has the benefit that it does not require image feature identification and calculation as a first step; rather, features are identified as part of the learning process. Machine learning has been used in medical imaging and will have a greater influence in the future. Those working in medical imaging must be aware of how machine learning works.©{RSNA}, 2017},

Thus, the proposed method can be useful for breast cancer diagnosis in real clinical practice. Experimental results based on our datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Machine learning promises to revolutionize clinical decision making and diagnosis. In medical diagnosis a doctor aims to explain a patient’s symptoms by determining the diseases causing them. However, existing machine learning approaches to diagnosis are purely associative, identifying diseases that are strongly correlated with a patients symptoms. We show that this inability to disentangle correlation from causation can result in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To overcome this, we reformulate diagnosis as a counterfactual inference task and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms. We compare our counterfactual algorithms to the standard associative algorithm and 44 doctors using a test set of clinical vignettes. While the associative algorithm achieves an accuracy placing in the top 48\% of doctors in our cohort, our counterfactual algorithm places in the top 25\% of doctors, achieving expert clinical accuracy. Our results show that causal reasoning is a vital missing ingredient for applying machine learning to medical diagnosis.},

We included all health care professionals in two university hospitals in the Netherlands.

A total of 975 (13\%) professionals responded to both before and after implementation questionnaires. In the formerly paper-based center staff perceived improvement in all themes after implementation. The legacy {EHR} center experienced deterioration of perceived {EHR} use and data reuse, and only one improvement in {EHR} use.

Though different {ML} models have been proposed, a systematic comparison of {ML} models in combination with imaging features derived from different modalities is still needed. In this study, we evaluate the prediction performance of 36 combinations of imaging features and {ML} models including deep learning. We utilize single and multimodal brain imaging data including {MRI}, {DTI}, and rs-{fMRI} from a large data set with 839 subjects. Our study is a follow-up to the initial work (Liang et al., 2019. Human Brain Mapping) to investigate different analytic strategies to combine data from {MRI}, {DTI}, and rs-{fMRI} with the goal to improve brain age prediction accuracy. Additionally, the traditional approach to predicting the brain age gap has been shown to have a systematic bias. The potential nonlinear relationship between the brain age gap and chronological age has not been thoroughly tested. Here we propose a new method to correct the systematic bias of brain age gap by taking gender, chronological age, and their interactions into consideration. As the true brain age is unknown and may deviate from chronological age, we further examine whether various levels of behavioral performance across subjects predict their brain age estimated from neuroimaging data. This is an important step to quantify the practical implication of brain age prediction. Our findings are helpful to advance the practice of optimizing different analytic methodologies in brain age prediction.},

We propose a modification of the Hempel-Oppenheim schema in which the logical relationships must only be satisfied “much” of the time, as determined by binomial significance tests. The analysis employs “certainty levels” logic with a more limited consistency requirement than classical logic. The analysis is applied to a series of 181 autopsied patients with leukemia in an attempt to determine a possible role of chemotherapeutic agents in the etiology of pulmonary edema. Among 51 patients who had received cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) within 30 days of death, there was significantly more unexplained moderate or massive pulmonary edema than among patients with no or remote therapy (p {\textless} 0.001).

It typically requires large amounts of labelled data; however, the sample size of such medical image datasets is generally small. This study proposes a novel training framework for building deep learning models of disease detection and classification with small datasets. Our approach is based on a hierarchical classification method where the healthy/disease information from the first model is effectively utilized to build subsequent models for classifying the disease into its sub-types via a transfer learning method. To improve accuracy, multiple input datasets were used, and a stacking ensembled method was employed for final classification. To demonstrate the method’s performance, a labelled dataset extracted from volumetric ophthalmic optical coherence tomography data for 156 healthy and 798 glaucoma eyes was used, in which glaucoma eyes were further labelled into four sub-types. The average weighted accuracy and Cohen’s kappa for three randomized test datasets were 0.839 and 0.809, respectively. Our approach outperformed the flat classification method by 9.7\% using smaller training datasets. The results suggest that the framework can perform accurate classification with a small number of medical images.},

However, most medical datasets are still too sparse to be useful for the training of modern machine learning techniques, and significant challenges remain before this is remedied. Combined efforts of data engineering, computational methods for analysis of heterogeneous data and instantiation of synergistic data models in biomedical research are required for success. In this Perspective, we offer our opinions on synthesizing complementary modalities of data with emerging multimodal artificial intelligence methods.

	abstract = {{GNE} myopathy, previously known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy ({HIBM}), or Nonaka myopathy, is a rare autosomal recessive muscle disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. It has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 9:1,000,000. {GNE} myopathy is caused by mutations in the {GNE} gene which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis. The pathophysiology of the disease is not entirely understood, but hyposialylation of muscle glycans is thought to play an essential role. The typical presentation is bilateral foot drop caused by weakness of the anterior tibialis muscles with onset in early adulthood. The disease slowly progresses over the next decades to involve skeletal muscles throughout the body, with relative sparing of the quadriceps until late stages of the disease. The diagnosis of {GNE} myopathy should be considered in young adults presenting with bilateral foot drop. Histopathologic findings on muscle biopsies include fiber size variation, atrophic fibers, lack of inflammation, and the characteristic "rimmed" vacuoles on modified Gomori trichome staining. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of pathogenic (mostly missense) mutations in both alleles of the {GNE} gene. Although there is no approved therapy for this disease, preclinical and clinical studies of several potential therapies are underway, including substrate replacement and gene therapy-based strategies. However, developing therapies for {GNE} myopathy is complicated by several factors, including the rare incidence of disease, limited preclinical models, lack of reliable biomarkers, and slow disease progression.},

Many of these technologies exploit historical patient health data to build powerful predictive models that can be used to improve diagnosis and understanding of disease. However, there are many issues concerning patient privacy that need to be accounted for in order to enable this data to be better harnessed by all sectors. One approach that could offer a method of circumventing privacy issues is the creation of realistic synthetic data sets that capture as many of the complexities of the original data set (distributions, non-linear relationships, and noise) but that does not actually include any real patient data. While previous research has explored models for generating synthetic data sets, here we explore the integration of resampling, probabilistic graphical modelling, latent variable identification, and outlier analysis for producing realistic synthetic data based on {UK} primary care patient data. In particular, we focus on handling missingness, complex interactions between variables, and the resulting sensitivity analysis statistics from machine learning classifiers, while quantifying the risks of patient re-identification from synthetic datapoints. We show that, through our approach of integrating outlier analysis with graphical modelling and resampling, we can achieve synthetic data sets that are not significantly different from original ground truth data in terms of feature distributions, feature dependencies, and sensitivity analysis statistics when inferring machine learning classifiers. What is more, the risk of generating synthetic data that is identical or very similar to real patients is shown to be low.},

Leveraging electronic health records to counterbalance these trends is an area of intense interest. The initial applications of electronic health records, as the primary data source is envisioned for observational studies, embedded pragmatic or post-marketing registry-based randomized studies, or comparative effectiveness studies. Advancing this approach to randomized clinical trials, electronic health records may potentially be used to assess study feasibility, to facilitate patient recruitment, and streamline data collection at baseline and follow-up. Ensuring data security and privacy, overcoming the challenges associated with linking diverse systems and maintaining infrastructure for repeat use of high quality data, are some of the challenges associated with using electronic health records in clinical research. Collaboration between academia, industry, regulatory bodies, policy makers, patients, and electronic health record vendors is critical for the greater use of electronic health records in clinical research. This manuscript identifies the key steps required to advance the role of electronic health records in cardiovascular clinical research.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic scalability is a major concern for any machine learning strategy in this age of ‘big data’. A large number of potentially predictive attributes is emblematic of problems in bioinformatics, genetic epidemiology, and many other fields. Previously, {ExS}-{TraCS} was introduced as an extended Michigan-style supervised learning classifier system that combined a set of powerful heuristics to successfully tackle the challenges of classification, prediction, and knowledge discovery in complex, noisy, and heterogeneous problem domains. While Michigan-style learning classifier systems are powerful and flexible learners, they are not considered to be particularly scalable. For the first time, this paper presents a complete description of the {ExS}-{TraCS} algorithm and introduces an effective strategy to dramatically improve learning classifier system scalability. {ExSTraCS} 2.0 addresses scalability with (1) a rule specificity limit, (2) new approaches to expert knowledge guided covering and mutation mechanisms, and (3) the implementation and utilization of the {TuRF} algorithm for improving the quality of expert knowledge discovery in larger datasets. Performance over a complex spectrum of simulated genetic datasets demonstrated that these new mechanisms dramatically improve nearly every performance metric on datasets with 20 attributes and made it possible for {ExSTraCS} to reliably scale up to perform on related 200 and 2000-attribute datasets. {ExSTraCS} 2.0 was also able to reliably solve the 6, 11, 20, 37, 70, and 135 multiplexer problems, and did so in similar or fewer learning iterations than previously reported, with smaller finite training sets, and without using building blocks discovered from simpler multiplexer problems. Furthermore, {ExS}-{TraCS} usability was made simpler through the elimination of previously critical run parameters.},

	abstract = {Objective: While most hospitals have adopted electronic health records ({EHRs}), we know little about whether hospitals use {EHRs} in advanced ways that are critical to improving outcomes, and whether hospitals with fewer resources - small, rural, safety-net - are keeping up.
Materials and Methods: Using 2008-2015 American Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement survey data, we measured "basic" and "comprehensive" {EHR} adoption among hospitals to provide the latest national numbers. We then used new supplement questions to assess advanced use of {EHRs} and {EHR} data for performance measurement and patient engagement functions. To assess a digital "advanced use" divide, we ran logistic regression models to identify hospital characteristics associated with high adoption in each advanced use domain.
Results: We found that 80.5\% of hospitals adopted at least a basic {EHR} system, a 5.3 percentage point increase from 2014. Only 37.5\% of hospitals adopted at least 8 (of 10) {EHR} data for performance measurement functions, and 41.7\% of hospitals adopted at least 8 (of 10) patient engagement functions. Critical access hospitals were less likely to have adopted at least 8 performance measurement functions (odds ratio [{OR}] = 0.58; P {\textless} .001) and at least 8 patient engagement functions ({OR} = 0.68; P = 0.02).
Discussion: While the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act resulted in widespread hospital {EHR} adoption, use of advanced {EHR} functions lags and a digital divide appears to be emerging, with critical-access hospitals in particular lagging behind. This is concerning, because {EHR}-enabled performance measurement and patient engagement are key contributors to improving hospital performance.
Conclusion: Hospital {EHR} adoption is widespread and many hospitals are using {EHRs} to support performance measurement and patient engagement. However, this is not happening across all hospitals.},

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from {DNA} sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the {DNA} sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

	volume = {316},
	issn = {1538-3598},
	doi = {10.1001/jama.2016.17216},
	abstract = {Importance: Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.
Objective: To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.
Design and Setting: A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 {US} licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 {US} board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.
Exposure: Deep learning-trained algorithm.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy ({RDR}), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.
Results: The {EyePACS}-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2\% women; prevalence of {RDR}, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8\%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6\% women; prevalence of {RDR}, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6\%]). For detecting {RDR}, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95\% {CI}, 0.988-0.993) for {EyePACS}-1 and 0.990 (95\% {CI}, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for {EyePACS}-1, the sensitivity was 90.3\% (95\% {CI}, 87.5\%-92.7\%) and the specificity was 98.1\% (95\% {CI}, 97.8\%-98.5\%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0\% (95\% {CI}, 81.1\%-91.0\%) and the specificity was 98.5\% (95\% {CI}, 97.7\%-99.1\%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for {EyePACS}-1 the sensitivity was 97.5\% and specificity was 93.4\% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1\% and specificity was 93.9\%.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.},

The Human Phenotype Ontology ({HPO}) uses clinical signs instead of diagnoses and has become the standard annotation for patients’ phenotypes when describing single gene disorders.

With {SAMS} (Symptom Annotation Made Simple), we want to bring sign-based phenotyping to routine clinical care, to hospital patients as well as to outpatients. Our web-based application provides access to three widely used annotation systems: {HPO}, {OMIM}, Orphanet. Whilst data can be stored in our database, phenotypes can also be imported and exported as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ({GA}4GH) Phenopackets without using the database. The web interface can easily be integrated into local databases, e.g. clinical information systems. {SAMS} offers users to share their data with others, empowering patients to record their own signs and symptoms (or those of their children) and thus provide their doctors with additional information. We think that our approach will lead to better characterised patients which is not only helpful for finding disease mutations but also to better understand the pathophysiology of diseases and to recruit patients for studies and clinical trials. {SAMS} is freely available at https://www.genecascade.org/{SAMS}/.},

	abstract = {Integration of detailed phenotype information with genetic data is well established to facilitate accurate diagnosis of hereditary disorders. As a rich source of phenotype information, electronic health records ({EHRs}) promise to empower diagnostic variant interpretation. However, how to accurately and efficiently extract phenotypes from heterogeneous {EHR} narratives remains a challenge. Here, we present {EHR}-Phenolyzer, a high-throughput {EHR} framework for extracting and analyzing phenotypes. {EHR}-Phenolyzer extracts and normalizes Human Phenotype Ontology ({HPO}) concepts from {EHR} narratives and then prioritizes genes with causal variants on the basis of the {HPO}-coded phenotype manifestations. We assessed {EHR}-Phenolyzer on 28 pediatric individuals with confirmed diagnoses of monogenic diseases and found that the genes with causal variants were ranked among the top 100 genes selected by {EHR}-Phenolyzer for 16/28 individuals (p {\textless} 2.2 × 10-16), supporting the value of phenotype-driven gene prioritization in diagnostic sequence interpretation. To assess the generalizability, we replicated this finding on an independent {EHR} dataset of ten individuals with a positive diagnosis from a different institution. We then assessed the broader utility by examining two additional {EHR} datasets, including 31 individuals who were suspected of having a Mendelian disease and underwent different types of genetic testing and 20 individuals with positive diagnoses of specific Mendelian etiologies of chronic kidney disease from exome sequencing. Finally, through several retrospective case studies, we demonstrated how combined analyses of genotype data and deep phenotype data from {EHRs} can expedite genetic diagnoses. In summary, {EHR}-Phenolyzer leverages {EHR} narratives to automate phenotype-driven analysis of clinical exomes or genomes, facilitating the broader implementation of genomic medicine.},

	abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ ({DCIS}) is a non-invasive breast cancer that can progress into invasive ductal carcinoma ({IDC}). Studies suggest {DCIS} is often overtreated since a considerable part of {DCIS} lesions may never progress into {IDC}. Lower grade lesions have a lower progression speed and risk, possibly allowing treatment de-escalation. However, studies show significant inter-observer variation in {DCIS} grading. Automated image analysis may provide an objective solution to address high subjectivity of {DCIS} grading by pathologists. In this study, we developed and evaluated a deep learning-based {DCIS} grading system. The system was developed using the consensus {DCIS} grade of three expert observers on a dataset of 1186 {DCIS} lesions from 59 patients. The inter-observer agreement, measured by quadratic weighted Cohen’s kappa, was used to evaluate the system and compare its performance to that of expert observers. We present an analysis of the lesion-level and patient-level inter-observer agreement on an independent test set of 1001 lesions from 50 patients. The deep learning system (dl) achieved on average slightly higher inter-observer agreement to the three observers (o1, o2 and o3) (κo1,dl = 0.81, κo2,dl = 0.53 and κo3,dl = 0.40) than the observers amongst each other (κo1,o2 = 0.58, κo1,o3 = 0.50 and κo2,o3 = 0.42) at the lesion-level. At the patient-level, the deep learning system achieved similar agreement to the observers (κo1,dl = 0.77, κo2,dl = 0.75 and κo3,dl = 0.70) as the observers amongst each other (κo1,o2 = 0.77, κo1,o3 = 0.75 and κo2,o3 = 0.72). The deep learning system better reflected the grading spectrum of {DCIS} than two of the observers. In conclusion, we developed a deep learning-based {DCIS} grading system that achieved a performance similar to expert observers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated system for the grading of {DCIS} that could assist pathologists by providing robust and reproducible second opinions on {DCIS} grade.},

	doi = {10.1002/path.5638},
	abstract = {Deep learning can detect microsatellite instability ({MSI}) from routine histology images in colorectal cancer ({CRC}). However, ethical and legal barriers impede sharing of images and genetic data, hampering development of new algorithms for detection of {MSI} and other biomarkers. We hypothesized that histology images synthesized by conditional generative adversarial networks ({CGANs}) retain information about genetic alterations. To test this, we developed a "histology {CGAN}" which was trained on 256 patients (training cohort 1) and 1457 patients (training cohort 2). The {CGAN} synthesized 10,000 synthetic {MSI} and non-{MSI} images which contained a range of tissue types and were deemed realistic by trained observers in a blinded study. Subsequently, we trained a Deep Learning detector of {MSI} on real or synthetic images and evaluated the performance of {MSI} detection in a held-out set of 142 patients. When trained on real images from training cohort 1, this system achieved an area under the receiver operating curve ({AUROC}) of 0.742 [0.681, 0.854]. Training on the larger cohort 2 only marginally improved the {AUROC} to 0.757 [0.707, 0.869]. Training on purely synthetic data resulted in an {AUROC} of 0.743 [0.658, 0.801]. Training on both real and synthetic data further increased {AUROC} to 0.777 [0.715, 0.821]. We conclude that synthetic histology images retain information reflecting underlying genetic alterations in colorectal cancer. Using synthetic instead of real images to train deep learning systems yields non-inferior classifiers. This approach can be used to create large shareable data sets or to augment small data sets with rare molecular features. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

This article summarizes the clinical and genetic aspects of these disorders.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Historically, diagnoses of congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy have been made by clinical features and histopathology; however, recent advances in genetics have changed diagnostic practice by relying more heavily on genetic findings. This article reviews the clinical and genetic features of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies including laminin subunit alpha 2 ({LAMA}2)-related (merosin deficient), collagen {VI}-related, and α-dystroglycan-related congenital muscular dystrophies and reviews the most common congenital myopathies including nemaline rod, core, and centronuclear myopathies. With the increasing accessibility of genetic testing, the number of genes found to be associated with these disorders has increased dramatically. A wide spectrum of severity and onset (from birth to adulthood) exist across all subtypes. Progression and other features are variable depending on the subtype and severity of the specific genetic mutation.
{SUMMARY}: Congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy are increasingly recognized disorders. A growing appreciation for the breadth of phenotypic variability and overlap between established subtypes has challenged long-standing phenotypic and histopathologic classifications of these disorders but has driven a greater understanding of pathogenesis and opened the door to the development of novel treatments.},

Artificial intelligence has shown great promise in classifying two-dimensional photographs of some common diseases and typically relies on databases of millions of annotated images. Until now, the challenge of reaching the performance of expert clinicians in a real-world clinical pathway with three-dimensional diagnostic scans has remained unsolved. Here, we apply a novel deep learning architecture to a clinically heterogeneous set of three-dimensional optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) scans from patients referred to a major eye hospital. We demonstrate performance in making a referral recommendation that reaches or exceeds that of experts on a range of sight-threatening retinal diseases after training on only 14,884 scans. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue segmentations produced by our architecture act as a device-independent representation; referral accuracy is maintained when using tissue segmentations from a different type of device. Our work removes previous barriers to wider clinical use without prohibitive training data requirements across multiple pathologies in a real-world setting.},

This process can be complicated by the fact that the features can have varying degrees of specificity, as well as by the presence of features unrelated to the disease itself. Depending on the experience of the physician and the availability of laboratory tests, clinical abnormalities may be described in greater or lesser detail. We have adapted semantic similarity metrics to measure phenotypic similarity between queries and hereditary diseases annotated with the use of the Human Phenotype Ontology ({HPO}) and have developed a statistical model to assign p values to the resulting similarity scores, which can be used to rank the candidate diseases. We show that our approach outperforms simpler term-matching approaches that do not take the semantic interrelationships between terms into account. The advantage of our approach was greater for queries containing phenotypic noise or imprecise clinical descriptions. The semantic network defined by the {HPO} can be used to refine the differential diagnosis by suggesting clinical features that, if present, best differentiate among the candidate diagnoses. Thus, semantic similarity searches in ontologies represent a useful way of harnessing the semantic structure of human phenotypic abnormalities to help with the differential diagnosis.

The X-linked form usually gives rise to a severe phenotype in males presenting at birth with marked weakness and hypotonia, external ophthalmoplegia and respiratory failure. Signs of antenatal onset comprise reduced foetal movements, polyhydramnios and thinning of the ribs on chest radiographs; birth asphyxia may be the present. Affected infants are often macrosomic, with length above the 90th centile and large head circumference. Testes are frequently undescended. Both autosomal-recessive ({AR}) and autosomal-dominant ({AD}) forms differ from the X-linked form regarding age at onset, severity, clinical characteristics and prognosis. In general, {AD} forms have a later onset and milder course than the X-linked form, and the {AR} form is intermediate in both respects.Mutations in the myotubularin ({MTM}1) gene on chromosome Xq28 have been identified in the majority of patients with the X-linked recessive form, whilst {AD} and {AR} forms have been associated with mutations in the dynamin 2 ({DNM}2) gene on chromosome 19p13.2 and the amphiphysin 2 ({BIN}1) gene on chromosome 2q14, respectively. Single cases with features of {CNM} have been associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor ({RYR}1) and the {hJUMPY} ({MTMR}14) genes.Diagnosis is based on typical histopathological findings on muscle biopsy in combination with suggestive clinical features; muscle magnetic resonance imaging may complement clinical assessment and inform genetic testing in cases with equivocal features. Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients and families in whom a diagnosis of {CNM} has been made.The main differential diagnoses include congenital myotonic dystrophy and other conditions with severe neonatal hypotonia.Management of {CNM} is mainly supportive, based on a multidisciplinary approach. Whereas the X-linked form due to {MTM}1 mutations is often fatal in infancy, dominant forms due to {DNM}2 mutations and some cases of the recessive {BIN}1-related form appear to be associated with an overall more favourable prognosis.},

We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.},

Features are extracted through an unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning phase. The network automatically extracts features from image patches. Logistic regression is used to classify the patches from histopathology images. The features extracted from the patches are fed to the model as input and the model presents the result as a probability matrix as either a positive sample (cancer) or a negative sample (background). The proposed model is trained and tested on the whole slide histopathology image dataset having images from four different data cohorts and achieved an accuracy of 86\%. Consequently, the proposed method is better than the traditional ones, as it automatically learns the best possible features and experimental results show that the model outperformed the previously proposed deep learning methods.},

	abstract = {Brain and breast tumors cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accurate and expedient histological diagnosis of patients’ tumor specimens is required for subsequent treatment and prognostication. Currently, histology slides are visually inspected by trained pathologists, but this process is both time and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose an automated process to classify histology slides of both brain and breast tissues using the Google Inception V3 convolutional neural network ({CNN}). We report successful automated classification of brain histology specimens into normal, low grade glioma ({LGG}) or high grade glioma ({HGG}). We also report for the first time the benefit of transfer learning across different tissue types. Pre-training on a brain tumor classification task improved {CNN} performance accuracy in a separate breast tumor classification task, with the F1 score improving from 0.547 to 0.913. We constructed a dataset using brain histology images from our own hospital and a public breast histology image dataset. Our proposed method can assist human pathologists in the triage and inspection of histology slides to expedite medical care. It can also improve {CNN} performance in cases where the training data is limited, for example in rare tumors, by applying the learned model weights from a more common tissue type.},

	abstract = {The detection, modeling and characterization of complex patterns of association in bioinformatics has focused on feature interactions and, more recently, instance-subgroup specific associations (e.g. genetic heterogeneity). Previously, attribute tracking was proposed as an instance-linked memory approach, leveraging the incremental learning of learning classifier systems ({LCSs}) to track which features were most useful in making class predictions within individual instances. These 'attribute tracking' signatures could later be used to characterize patterns of association in the data. While effective, true underlying patterns remain difficult to characterize in noisy problems, and the original approach places equal weight on tracked feature scores obtained early as well as late in learning. In this work we investigate alternative strategies for attribute tracking scoring, including the adoption of a time recency update scheme taken from reinforcement learning, to gain insight into how to optimize this approach to improve modeling performance and downstream pattern interpretability. We report mixed results over a variety of performance metrics that point to promising future directions for building effective building blocks and improving model interpretability.},

However, there are rising concerns about patient privacy in sharing medical and healthcare data. A large amount of these data are in free text form. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing deal largely with structured data. Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identifiers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics fields. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a value-enumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world medical documents. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The diagnosis of congenital myopathies is constrained by strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, the majority of patients present with unspecific histological features, precluding purposive molecular diagnosis and demonstrating the need for an alternative and more efficient diagnostic approach. We used exome sequencing complemented by histological and ultrastructural analysis of muscle biopsies to identify the causative mutations in eight patients with clinically different skeletal muscle pathologies, ranging from a fatal neonatal myopathy to a mild and slowly progressive myopathy with adult onset. We identified {RYR}1 (ryanodine receptor) mutations in six patients and {NEB} (nebulin) mutations in two patients. We found novel missense and nonsense mutations, unraveled small insertions/deletions and confirmed their impact on splicing and {mRNA}/protein stability. Histological and ultrastructural findings of the muscle biopsies of the patients validated the exome sequencing results. We provide the evidence that an integrated strategy combining exome sequencing with clinical and histopathological investigations overcomes the limitations of the individual approaches to allow a fast and efficient diagnosis, accelerating the patient's access to a better healthcare and disease management. This is of particular interest for the diagnosis of congenital myopathies, which involve very large genes like {RYR}1 and {NEB} as well as genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity.},

To date, {CNM} epidemiologic reports provide limited incidence and prevalence data. Here, an integrated model utilizing available literature is proposed to obtain a better estimate of overall {CNM} patient numbers by age, causative gene, severity and geographic region. This model combines published epidemiology data and extrapolates limited data over {CNM} subtypes, resulting in patient numbers related to age and disease subtype. Further, the model calculates a {CNM} incidence twofold the current estimates. The estimated incidence of 17 per million births for severe X-linked myotubular myopathy ({XLMTM}), the main subtype of {CNM}, corresponds to an estimated prevalence of 2715 in the {US}, 1204 in the {EU}, 688 in Japan and 72 in Australia. In conclusion, the model provides an estimate of the {CNM} incidence, prevalence and survival, and indicates that the current estimates do not fully capture the true incidence and prevalence. With rapid advances in genetic therapies, robust epidemiologic data are needed to further quantify the reliability of incidence, prevalence and survival rates for the different {CNM} subtypes.},

Our method leverages the unified memory mechanism to overcome the memory constraint of compute accelerators. Experiments conducted on a data set of 9662 lung cancer {WSIs} reveal that the proposed method achieves areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9594 and 0.9414 for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma classification on the testing set, respectively.

Though crowdsourcing has enabled annotation of large scale databases for real world images, its application for biomedical purposes requires a deeper understanding and hence, more precise definition of the actual annotation task. The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) via additional crowdsourcing layer ({AggNet}). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep {CNN} be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the {CNN} to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy? Our experimental setup involved Annot8, a self-implemented web-platform based on Crowdflower {API} realizing image annotation tasks for a publicly available biomedical image database. Our results give valuable insights into the functionality of deep {CNN} learning from crowd annotations and prove the necessity of data aggregation integration.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetic muscle diseases with variable distribution of weakness and mode of inheritance.
{METHODS}: We previously performed a systematic review of worldwide population-based studies on Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies; the current study focused on the epidemiology of other muscular dystrophies using Medline and {EMBASE} databases. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts, full-text articles, and abstracted data from 1985 to 2011. Pooling of prevalence estimates was performed using random-effect models.
{RESULTS}: A total of 1104 abstracts and 167 full-text articles were reviewed. Thirty-one studies met all eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of combined muscular dystrophies was 16.14 (confidence interval [{CI}], 11.21-23.23) per 100,000. The prevalence estimates per 100,000 were 8.26 ({CI}, 4.99-13.68) for myotonic dystrophy, 3.95 ({CI}, 2.89-5.40) for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, 1.63 ({CI}, 0.94-2.81) for limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and 0.99 ({CI}, 0.62-1.57) for congenital muscular dystrophies.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The studies differed widely in their approaches to case ascertainment, and substantial gaps remain in the global estimates of many other types of muscular dystrophies. Additional epidemiological studies using standardized diagnostic criteria as well as multiple sources of case ascertainment will help address the economic impact and health care burden of muscular dystrophies worldwide.},

Pertinent negatives are evident in text but are not usually indexed in structured databases. The objective of the study reported here was to test a simple algorithm for determining whether a finding or disease mentioned within narrative medical reports is present or absent. We developed a simple regular expression algorithm called {NegEx} that implements several phrases indicating negation, filters out sentences containing phrases that falsely appear to be negation phrases, and limits the scope of the negation phrases. We compared {NegEx} against a baseline algorithm that has a limited set of negation phrases and a simpler notion of scope. In a test of 1235 findings and diseases in 1000 sentences taken from discharge summaries indexed by physicians, {NegEx} had a specificity of 94.5\% (versus 85.3\% for the baseline), a positive predictive value of 84.5\% (versus 68.4\% for the baseline) while maintaining a reasonable sensitivity of 77.8\% (versus 88.3\% for the baseline). We conclude that with little implementation effort a simple regular expression algorithm for determining whether a finding or disease is absent can identify a large portion of the pertinent negatives from discharge summaries.},

A Z-number, Z, has two components, Z=(A,B). The first component, A, is a restriction (constraint) on the values which a real-valued uncertain variable, X, is allowed to take. The second component, B, is a measure of reliability (certainty) of the first component. Typically, A and B are described in a natural language. Example: (about 45min, very sure). An important issue relates to computation with Z-numbers. Examples: What is the sum of (about 45min, very sure) and (about 30min, sure)? What is the square root of (approximately 100, likely)? Computation with Z-numbers falls within the province of Computing with Words ({CW} or {CWW}). In this note, the concept of a Z-number is introduced and methods of computation with Z-numbers are outlined. The concept of a Z-number has a potential for many applications, especially in the realms of economics, decision analysis, risk assessment, prediction, anticipation and rule-based characterization of imprecise functions and relations.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous epidemiological studies of genetic muscle disorders have relied on medical records to identify cases and may be at risk of selection biases or have focused on selective population groups.
{OBJECTIVES}: This study aimed to determine age-standardised prevalence of genetic muscle disorders through a nationwide, epidemiological study across the lifespan using the capture-recapture method.
{METHODS}: Adults and children with a confirmed clinical or molecular diagnosis of a genetic muscle disorder, resident in New Zealand on April 1, 2015 were identified using multiple overlapping sources. Genetic muscle disorders included the muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, ion channel myopathies, {GNE} myopathy, and Pompe disease. Prevalence per 100,000 persons by age, sex, disorder, ethnicity and geographical region with 95\% {CIs} was calculated using Poisson distribution. Direct standardisation was applied to age-standardise prevalence to the world population. Completeness of case ascertainment was determined using capture-recapture modelling.
{RESULTS}: Age standardised minimal point prevalence of all genetic muscle disorders was 22.3 per 100,000 (95\% {CI} 19.5-25.6). Prevalence in Europeans of 24.4 per 100,000, (95\% {CI} 21.1-28.3) was twice that observed in {NZ}'s other 3 main ethnic groups; Māori (12.6 per 100,000, 95\% {CI} 7.8-20.5), Pasifika (11.0 per 100,000, 95\% {CI} 5.4-23.3), and Asian (9.13 per 100,000, 95\% {CI} 5.0-17.8). Crude prevalence of myotonic dystrophy was 3 times higher in Europeans (10.5 per 100,000, 9.4-11.8) than Māori and Pasifika (2.5 per 100,000, 95\% {CI} 1.5-4.2 and 0.7 per 100,000, 95\% {CI} 0.1-2.7 respectively). There were considerable regional variations in prevalence, although there was no significant association with social deprivation. The final capture-recapture model, with the least deviance, estimated the study ascertained 99.2\% of diagnosed cases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Ethnic and regional differences in the prevalence of genetic muscle disorders need to be considered in service delivery planning, evaluation, and decision making.},

Currently software tools on medical devices are able to extract some parameters that can indicate the presence of diseases. Nevertheless, there still is a lot of not exploited information contained in images which can be useful for research as well as to characterize human behavior. For instance, measures for lung volume compared with reference data sets can be studied starting from clinical images. In this paper we report preliminary results on a framework for the acquisition and decomposition of {DICOM} images applied on a dataset containing lung exams from which we extracted information and parameters useful for disease research studies. The here proposed algorithms for images segmentation and anatomical features extraction have been tested on a clinical dataset obtained from University Hospital of Catanzaro, providing the framework validity.},

The consequent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can be fatal for patients. In this study, we trained and evaluated the performance of a vertebral body segmentation model and a vertebral compression measurement model based on convolutional neural networks. For vertebral body segmentation, we used a recurrent residual U-Net model, with an average sensitivity of 0.934 (± 0.086), an average specificity of 0.997 (± 0.002), an average accuracy of 0.987 (± 0.005), and an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.923 (± 0.073). We then generated 1134 data points on the images of three vertebral bodies by labeling each segment of the segmented vertebral body. These were used in the vertebral compression measurement model based on linear regression and multi-scale residual dilated blocks. The model yielded an average mean absolute error of 2.637 (± 1.872) (\%), an average mean square error of 13.985 (± 24.107) (\%), and an average root mean square error of 3.739 (± 2.187) (\%) in fractured vertebral body data. The proposed algorithm has significant potential for aiding the diagnosis of vertebral compression fractures.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056641},
	abstract = {Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve head ({ONH}) causing loss of vision. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are important in preventing possible blindness caused by glaucoma. Its current identification is based on the manual segmentation of the optic cup and disc to examine the cup-to-disc ratio ({CDR}). However, experts’ annotation of these regions is a rather difficult and tedious task. Employing a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) for diagnosing glaucoma could be an alternative solution. However, its performance depends on the availability of a large number of labeled samples for the training phase. This paper presents an automatic glaucoma diagnosing framework based on three convolutional neural network ({CNN}) models with different learning methods, and compares the performance of these models with ophthalmologists. We use transfer and semi-supervised learning methods based on both labeled and unlabeled data. First, the transfer learning model starts with a pre-trained {CNN} model that was trained with non-medical data and fine-tunes it with our labeled data. Secondly, a semi-supervised framework is developed and trained using both labeled and unlabeled data based on two different unsupervised methods. The experimental results using two datasets, {RIM}-{ONE} and {RIGA}, demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning models when applied to glaucoma, which is a promising step towards automated screening for identifying individuals with early-stage glaucoma. Compared with annotations by two ophthalmologists, all the presented models achieve better performances, demonstrating the capability of artificial intelligence in diagnosing glaucoma with a high level of reliability.},

	title = {Soft-Label Dataset Distillation and Text Dataset Distillation},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02551},
	abstract = {Dataset distillation is a method for reducing dataset sizes by learning a small number of synthetic samples containing all the information of a large dataset. This has several benefits like speeding up model training, reducing energy consumption, and reducing required storage space. Currently, each synthetic sample is assigned a single `hard' label, and also, dataset distillation can currently only be used with image data. We propose to simultaneously distill both images and their labels, thus assigning each synthetic sample a `soft' label (a distribution of labels). Our algorithm increases accuracy by 2-4\% over the original algorithm for several image classification tasks. Using `soft' labels also enables distilled datasets to consist of fewer samples than there are classes as each sample can encode information for multiple classes. For example, training a {LeNet} model with 10 distilled images (one per class) results in over 96\% accuracy on {MNIST}, and almost 92\% accuracy when trained on just 5 distilled images. We also extend the dataset distillation algorithm to distill sequential datasets including texts. We demonstrate that text distillation outperforms other methods across multiple datasets. For example, models attain almost their original accuracy on the {IMDB} sentiment analysis task using just 20 distilled sentences.

These results have been achieved in a control environment, that is the highly curated {ImageNet} dataset. However, the premise of self-supervised learning is that it can learn from any random image and from any unbounded dataset. In this work, we explore if self-supervision lives to its expectation by training large models on random, uncurated images with no supervision. Our ﬁnal {SElf}-{supERvised} ({SEER}) model, a {RegNetY} with 1.3B parameters trained on 1B random images with 512 {GPUs} achieves 84.2\% top-1 accuracy, surpassing the best self-supervised pretrained model by 1\% and conﬁrming that self-supervised learning works in a real world setting. Interestingly, we also observe that selfsupervised models are good few-shot learners achieving 77.9\% top-1 with access to only 10\% of {ImageNet}.},

Training on much smaller training sets while maintaining nearly the same accuracy would be very beneficial. In the few-shot learning setting, a model must learn a new class given only a small number of samples from that class. One-shot learning is an extreme form of few-shot learning where the model must learn a new class from a single example. We propose the `less than one'-shot learning task where models must learn \$N\$ new classes given only \$M{\textless}N\$ examples and we show that this is achievable with the help of soft labels. We use a soft-label generalization of the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to explore the intricate decision landscapes that can be created in the `less than one'-shot learning setting.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04886},
	abstract = {A large labeled dataset is a key to the success of supervised deep learning, but for medical image segmentation, it is highly challenging to obtain suﬃcient annotated images for model training. In many scenarios, unannotated images are abundant and easy to acquire. Self-supervised learning ({SSL}) has shown great potentials in exploiting raw data information and representation learning. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Supervised Learning ({HSSL}), a new self-supervised framework that boosts medical image segmentation by making good use of unannotated data. Unlike the current literature on task-speciﬁc self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised ﬁne-tuning, we utilize {SSL} to learn task-agnostic knowledge from heterogeneous data for various medical image segmentation tasks. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst aggregate a dataset from several medical challenges, then pre-train the network in a self-supervised manner, and ﬁnally ﬁne-tune on labeled data. We develop a new loss function by combining contrastive loss and classiﬁcation loss, and pre-train an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation tasks. Our extensive experiments show that multi-domain joint pretraining beneﬁts downstream segmentation tasks and outperforms singledomain pre-training signiﬁcantly. Compared to learning from scratch, our method yields better performance on various tasks (e.g., +0.69\% to +18.60\% in Dice with 5\% of annotated data). With limited amounts of training data, our method can substantially bridge the performance gap with respect to denser annotations (e.g., 10\% vs. 100\% annotations).},

	shorttitle = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence ({XAI})},
	abstract = {In the last few years, Artiﬁcial Intelligence ({AI}) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the ﬁeld. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of {AI} (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called {eXplainable} {AI} ({XAI}) ﬁeld, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of {AI} models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the ﬁeld of {XAI}, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to deﬁne explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel deﬁnition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this deﬁnition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by {XAI}, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artiﬁcial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of {AI} methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the ﬁeld of {XAI} with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the beneﬁts of {AI} in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

Second, these features are also excellent k-{NN} classifiers, reaching 78.3\% top-1 on {ImageNet} with a small {ViT}. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with {ViTs}. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called {DINO}, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between {DINO} and {ViTs} by achieving 80.1\% top-1 on {ImageNet} in linear evaluation with {ViT}-Base.},

On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their application to modeling tabular data (inference or generation) remains highly challenging. This work provides an overview of state of the art deep learning methods for tabular data. We start by categorizing them into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. We then provide a comprehensive overview of the main approaches in each group. A discussion of deep learning approaches for generating tabular data is complemented by strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Our primary contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in this area, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. We also provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with deep learning approaches on real tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results indicate that algorithms based on gradientboosted tree ensembles still outperform the deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst in-depth look at deep learning approaches for tabular data.

However, few {ALCS} can efficiently run in such environments. Among those {ALCS}, only a very limited number of aliased mazes have been used to test the capabilities of such systems. It is possible to chain classifiers of {ALCS} to build Behavioral sequences. Those sequences permit {ALCS} to deal with aliased environments, but they have never been used within {ACS}2, yet one of the most advanced {ALCS}. We then propose a novel learning classifier system, {BACS}, that integrates Behavioral sequences to {ACS}2. We enhanced the selection policy, integrated an aliasing detection algorithm that let the system build the behavioral classifiers, and evolved the anticipatory learning process. {BACS} performs better or at least as well as other {ALCS} on an exhaustive maze benchmark. We show that behavioral sequences are a suitable approach to fix the perceptual aliasing issue.},

	abstract = {Background: Congenital myopathy constitutes a heterogeneous group of orphan diseases that are mainly classified on the basis of muscle biopsy findings. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of congenital myopathy through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.Methods: The {PubMed}, {MEDLINE}, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for original research articles published in English prior to July 30, 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed by a checklist adapted from {STrengthening} the Reporting of {OBservational} studies in Epidemiology ({STROBE}). To derive the pooled epidemiological prevalence estimates, a meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic as well as the I2 statistic.Results: A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Of the 11 studies included, 10 (90.9\%) were considered medium-quality, one (9.1\%) was considered low-quality, and no study was assessed as having a high overall quality. The pooled prevalence of congenital myopathy in the all-age population was 1.62 (95\% {CI}, 1.13–2.11) per 100,000, while the prevalence in the child population was 2.76 (95\% {CI}, 1.34–4.18) per 100,000. In the pediatric population, the prevalence among males was 2.92 (95\% {CI}, −1.70 to 7.55) per 100,000, while the prevalence among females was 2.47 (95\% {CI}, −1.67 to 6.61) per 100,000. The prevalence estimates of the all-age population per 100,000 were 0.20 (95\% {CI} 0.10–0.35) for nemaline myopathy, 0.37 (95\% {CI} 0.21–0.53) for core myopathy, 0.08 (95\% {CI} −0.01 to 0.18) for centronuclear myopathy, 0.23 (95\% {CI} 0.04–0.42) for congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy, and 0.34 (95\% {CI}, 0.24–0.44) for unspecified congenital myopathies. In addition, the prevalence estimates of the pediatric population per 100,000 were 0.22 (95\% {CI} 0.03–0.40) for nemaline myopathy, 0.46 (95\% {CI} 0.03–0.90) for core myopathy, 0.44 (95\% {CI} 0.03–0.84) for centronuclear myopathy, 0.25 (95\% {CI} −0.05 to 0.54) for congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy, and 2.63 (95\% {CI} 1.64–3.62) for unspecified congenital myopathies.Conclusions: Accurate estimates of the prevalence of congenital myopathy are fundamental to supporting public health decision-making. The high heterogeneity and the lack of high-quality studies highlight the need to conduct higher-quality studies on orphan diseases.},

	shorttitle = {A Rigorous Machine Learning Analysis Pipeline for Biomedical Binary Classification},
	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) offers a collection of powerful approaches for detecting and modeling associations, often applied to data having a large number of features and/or complex associations. Currently, there are many tools to facilitate implementing custom {ML} analyses (e.g. scikit-learn). Interest is also increasing in automated {ML} packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply {ML} and have the potential to improve model performance. {ML} permeates most subﬁelds of biomedical research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. Tremendous opportunities offered by {ML} are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling comprehensive analysis pipelines, and the ease of {ML} misuse. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous {ML} analysis pipeline focused on binary classiﬁcation (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to both simulated and real world data. At a high level, this ’automated’ but customizable pipeline includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection, d) model training with 9 established {ML} algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations. This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of {ML} pipeline assembly to illustrate best practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the ﬁrst to compare established {ML} algorithms to ’{ExSTraCS}’, a rule-based {ML} algorithm with the unique capability of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association. While designed to be widely applicable we apply this pipeline to an epidemiological investigation of established and newly identiﬁed risk factors for pancreatic cancer to evaluate how different sources of bias might be handled by {ML} algorithms.},

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) research has yielded powerful tools for training accurate prediction models despite complex multivariate associations (e.g. interactions and heterogeneity). In ﬁelds such as medicine, improved interpretability of {ML} modeling is required for knowledge discovery, accountability, and fairness.

This work introduces the {LCS} Discovery and Visualization Environment ({LCS}-{DIVE}), an automated {LCS} model interpretation pipeline for complex biomedical classiﬁcation. {LCS}-{DIVE} conducts modeling using a new scikit-learn implementation of {ExSTraCS}, an {LCS} designed to overcome noise and scalability in biomedical data mining yielding human readable ‘{IF}:{THEN}’ rules as well as ‘feature-tracking’ scores for each training sample. {LCS}-{DIVE} leverages feature-tracking scores and/or rules to automatically guide characterization of (1) feature importance (2) underlying additive, epistatic, and/or heterogeneous patterns of association, and (3) model-driven heterogeneous instance subgroups via clustering, visualization generation, and cluster interrogation. {LCS}-{DIVE} was evaluated over a diverse set of simulated genetic and benchmark datasets encoding a variety of complex multivariate associations, demonstrating its ability to differentiate between them and then applied to characterize associations within a real-world study of pancreatic cancer.},

This efficiency is achieved by using {ImgLib}2 and {BigDataViewer} as well as a memory efficient and fast implementation of the random forest based pixel classification algorithm as the foundation of our software. Optionally we harness the power of graphics processing units ({GPU}) to gain additional runtime performance. {LABKIT} is easy to install on virtually all laptops and workstations. Additionally, {LABKIT} is compatible with high performance computing ({HPC}) clusters for distributed processing of big image data. The ability to use pixel classifiers trained in {LABKIT} via the {ImageJ} macro language enables our users to integrate this functionality as a processing step in automated image processing workflows.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04645},
	abstract = {Electronic Health Records ({EHRs}) provide vital contextual information to radiologists and other physicians when making a diagnosis. Unfortunately, because a given patient's record may contain hundreds of notes and reports, identifying relevant information within these in the short time typically allotted to a case is very difficult. We propose and evaluate models that extract relevant text snippets from patient records to provide a rough case summary intended to aid physicians considering one or more diagnoses. This is hard because direct supervision (i.e., physician annotations of snippets relevant to specific diagnoses in medical records) is prohibitively expensive to collect at scale. We propose a distantly supervised strategy in which we use groups of International Classification of Diseases ({ICD}) codes observed in 'future' records as noisy proxies for 'downstream' diagnoses. Using this we train a transformer-based neural model to perform extractive summarization conditioned on potential diagnoses. This model defines an attention mechanism that is conditioned on potential diagnoses (queries) provided by the diagnosing physician. We train (via distant supervision) and evaluate variants of this model on {EHR} data from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and {MIMIC}-{III} (the latter to facilitate reproducibility). Evaluations performed by radiologists demonstrate that these distantly supervised models yield better extractive summaries than do unsupervised approaches. Such models may aid diagnosis by identifying sentences in past patient reports that are clinically relevant to a potential diagnosis.},

	title = {“Opposite-of”-information improves similarity calculations in phenotype ontologies},
	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/108977},
	abstract = {One of the most important use cases of ontologies is the calculation of similarity scores between a query and items annotated with classes of an ontology. The hierarchical structure of an ontology does not necessarily reﬂect all relevant aspects of the domain it is modelling, and this can reduce the performance of ontology-based search algorithms. For instance, the classes of phenotype ontologies may be arranged according to anatomical criteria, but individual phenotypic features may aﬀect anatomic entities in opposite ways. Thus, “opposite” classes may be located in close proximity in an ontology; for example enlarged liver and small liver are grouped under abnormal liver size. Using standard similarity measures, these would be scored as being similar, despite in fact being opposites. In this paper, we use information about opposite ontology classes to extend two large phenotype ontologies, the human and the mammalian phenotype ontology. We also show that this information can be used to improve rankings based on similarity measures that incorporate this information. In particular, cosine similarity based measures show large improvements. We hypothesize this is due to the natural embedding of opposite phenotypes in vector space. We support the idea that the expressivity of semantic web technologies should be explored more extensively in biomedical ontologies and that similarity measures should be extended to incorporate more than the pure graph structure deﬁned by the subclass or part-of relationships of the underlying ontologies.},

In this paper, we use influence functions -- a classic technique from robust statistics -- to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.},

	abstract = {Hypertrophy and impaired mineralization are two processes closely associated with osteoarthritis ({OA}). 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1a,25({OH})(2)D(3)) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are two important factors that are implicated in calcium and phosphate homeostasis of bone metabolism and both can be regulated by the circulating phosphaturic factor fibroblast growth factor 23 ({FGF}23). The objective of this study was to investigate the role of 1a,25({OH})(2)D(3) and Pi and the molecular mechanism through which they contribute to hypertrophy and mineralization in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes. For this purpose, primary human chondrocytes were obtained from articular cartilage which was collected after total knee replacement surgery in {OA} patients. {FGF}23, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1c ({FGFR}1c), vitamin D(3) receptor ({VDR}), and phosphate inorganic transporter-1 and -2 ({PiT}-1 and {PiT}-2) expression levels were evaluated and found to be significantly higher in {OA} chondrocytes compared with normal. In addition, we observed that the binding of {FGF}23 to {FGFR}1c was stronger in {OA} chondrocytes compared with normal. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP}) assay revealed, for the first time, the presence of two vitamin D response elements ({VDREs}) in the {FGF}23 promoter. Treatment of normal chondrocytes with 1a,25({OH})(2)D(3) or Pi resulted in significant up-regulation of {VDR}, {FGF}23, {PiT}-1, {PiT}-2 {mRNA} and protein levels, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 ({ERK}1/2) phosphorylation and induction of hypertrophy markers collagen type X ({COL}10A1), osteopontin ({OPN}), osteocalcin ({OC}), catabolic markers metalloproteinase-13 ({MMP}-13) and the apoptotic marker caspase-9. Furthermore, {VDR} silencing in {OA} chondrocytes negatively regulated {FGF}23, {COL}10A1, {OPN}, {OC}, {MMP}-13 and caspase-9 expressions and {ERK}1/2 phosphorylation. Finally, combined {VDR} silencing and {PiT}-1, {PiT}-2 inhibition in {OA} chondrocytes resulted in additive down-regulation of {FGF}23 expression, {ERK}1/2 activation and {COL}10A1, {OPN}, {OC}, {MMP}-13 and caspase-9 expression levels. We propose that 1a,25({OH})(2)D(3) and Pi act synergistically through {FGF}23 signaling and {ERK}1/2 phosphorylation contributing to late hypertrophic events and impaired mineralization in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Alemtuzumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that alters the circulating lymphocyte pool, causing prolonged lymphopenia, thus remoulding the immune repertoire that accompanies homeostatic lymphocyte reconstitution. It has been proved more effective than interferon ({IFN}) 1a for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ({RRMS}). {OBJECTIVES}: To compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of alemtuzumab versus interferon beta 1a in the treatment of people with {RRMS} to prevent disease activity. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the {CNS} Group Trials Register (1 February 2017) which, among other sources, contains records from {CENTRAL}, {MEDLINE}, Embase, {CINAHL}, {LILACS}, {PEDRO} and the trial registry databases Clinical Trials.gov and {WHO} International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for all prospectively registered and ongoing trials. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: All double-blind, randomised, controlled trials comparing intravenous alemtuzumab (12 mg per day or 24 mg per day on five consecutive days during the first month and on three consecutive days at months 12 and 24) versus subcutaneous {IFN} beta 1a (22 μg or 44 μg three times per week (Rebif) or intramuscular injection 30 μg once a week (Avonex)) in people of any gender and age with {RRMS}. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included three trials involving 1694 participants. All trials compared alemtuzumab 12 mg per day or 24 mg per day versus {IFN} beta 1a for treating {RRMS}. In {CAMMS}223, participants received either subcutaneous {IFN} beta 1a 44 μg three times per week or annual intravenous cycles of alemtuzumab (at a dose of 12 mg per day or 24 mg per day) for 36 months. In {CARE}-{MS} I and {CARE}-{MS} {II}, participants received subcutaneous {IFN} beta 1a 44 μg three times per week or annual intravenous cycles of alemtuzumab 12 mg per day for 24 months. The methodological quality was good for all three studies.In the alemtuzumab 12 mg per day group, the results showed statistically significant difference in reducing relapses (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.60, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.52 to 0.70), preventing disease progression ({RR} 0.60, 95\% {CI} 0.45 to 0.79) and developing new T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging ({RR} 0.75, 95\% {CI} 0.61 to 0.93) after 24 and 36 months' follow-up, but found no statistically significant difference in the changes of Expanded Disability Status Scale ({EDSS}) score (mean difference ({MD}) -0.35, 95\% {CI} -0.73 to 0.03). In the alemtuzumab 24 mg per day group, the results showed statistically significant differences in reducing relapses ({RR} 0.38, 95\% {CI} 0.23 to 0.62), preventing disease progression ({RR} 0.42, 95\% {CI} 0.21 to 0.84) and the changes of {EDSS} score ({MD} -0.83, 95\% {CI} -1.17 to -0.49) after 36 months' follow-up.All three trials reported adverse events and serious adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of participants with at least one adverse event ({RR} 1.03, 95\% {CI} 0.97 to 1.08) and the number of participants who experienced serious adverse events ({RR} 1.03, 95\% {CI} 0.83 to 4.54). {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that annual intravenous cycles of alemtuzumab at a dose of 12 mg per day or 24 mg per day reduces the proportion of participants with relapses, disease progression, change of {EDSS} score and developing new T2 lesions on {MRI} over 24 to 36 months in comparison with subcutaneous {IFN} beta-1a 44 μg three times per week.Alemtuzumab appeared to be relatively well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events were infusion-associated reactions, infections and autoimmune events. The use of alemtuzumab requires careful monitoring so that potentially serious adverse effects can be treated early and effectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Open access ({OA}) is a revolutionary way of providing access to the scholarly journal literature made possible by the Internet. The primary aim of this study was to measure the volume of scientific articles published in full immediate {OA} journals from 2000 to 2011, while observing longitudinal internal shifts in the structure of {OA} publishing concerning revenue models, publisher types and relative distribution among scientific disciplines. The secondary aim was to measure the share of {OA} articles of all journal articles, including articles made {OA} by publishers with a delay and individual author-paid {OA} articles in subscription journals (hybrid {OA}), as these subsets of {OA} publishing have mostly been ignored in previous studies. Methods: Stratified random sampling of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (n = 787) was performed. The annual publication volumes spanning 2000 to 2011 were retrieved from major publication indexes and through manual data collection. Results: An estimated 340,000 articles were published by 6,713 full immediate {OA} journals during 2011. {OA} journals requiring article-processing charges have become increasingly common, publishing 166,700 articles in 2011 (49\% of all {OA} articles). This growth is related to the growth of commercial publishers, who, despite only a marginal presence a decade ago, have grown to become key actors on the {OA} scene, responsible for 120,000 of the articles published in 2011. Publication volume has grown within all major scientific disciplines, however, biomedicine has seen a particularly rapid 16-fold growth between 2000 (7,400 articles) and 2011 (120,900 articles). Over the past decade, {OA} journal publishing has steadily increased its relative share of all scholarly journal articles by about 1\% annually. Approximately 17\% of the 1.66 million articles published during 2011 and indexed in the most comprehensive article-level index of scholarly articles (Scopus) are available {OA} through journal publishers, most articles immediately (12\%) but some within 12 months of publication (5\%). Conclusions: {OA} journal publishing is disrupting the dominant subscription-based model of scientific publishing, having rapidly grown in relative annual share of published journal articles during the last decade.},

Just consider how similar in size and shape your two ears are. And if you extend your arms, you will likely find that they, too, are similar in length, even though they grew independently from tiny buds in the embryo. Their length matches with an accuracy of about 0.2\% yet there is no known communication between the limbs during growth. You'll find the same holds for your two forefingers as it does for the size of internal body organs such as the kidneys and lungs. How is such coordination achieved?

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: While factors affecting the course of knee osteoarthritis are mostly unknown, lesions on bone scan and mechanical malalignment increase risk for radiographic deterioration. Bone marrow edema lesions on magnetic resonance imaging correspond to bone scan lesions. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether edema lesions in the subarticular bone in patients with knee osteoarthritis identify knees at high risk for radiographic progression and whether these lesions are associated with limb malalignment. {DESIGN}: Natural history study. {SETTING}: A Veterans Administration hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. {PATIENTS}: Persons 45 years of age and older with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. {MEASUREMENTS}: Baseline assessments included magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and fluoroscopically positioned radiography. During follow-up at 15 and 30 months, patients underwent repeated radiography; at 15 months, long-limb films were obtained to assess mechanical alignment. Progression was defined as an increase over follow-up in medial or lateral joint space narrowing, based on a semi-quantitative grading. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the relation of medial bone marrow edema lesions to medial progression and lateral lesions to lateral progression, before and after adjustment for limb alignment. {RESULTS}: Of 256 patients, 223 (87.1\%) participated in at least one follow-up examination. Medial bone marrow lesions were seen mostly in patients with varus limbs, and lateral lesions were seen mostly in those with valgus limbs. Twenty-seven of 75 knees with medial lesions (36.0\%) showed medial progression versus 12 of 148 knees without lesions (8.1\%) (odds ratio for progression, 6.5 [95\% {CI}, 3.0 to 14.0]). Approximately 69\% of knees that progressed medially had medial lesions, and lateral lesions conferred a marked risk for lateral progression. These increased risks were attenuated by 37\% to 53\% after adjustment for limb alignment. {CONCLUSION}: Bone marrow edema is a potent risk factor for structural deterioration in knee osteoarthritis, and its relation to progression is explained in part by its association with limb alignment.},

Coronal {MRI} of hips was acquired in 19 patients who underwent hip replacement. A spin echo ({SE}) sequence with four echoes and separate fast spin echo ({FSE}) proton density ({PD})-weighted {SE} sequences of fat (F) and water (W) were acquired with water and fat suppression, respectively. T2 and water:fat ratio calculations were made for the outlined regions of interest. The calculated {MRI} values were correlated with the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings. {RESULTS}: Analyses of variance were done on the {MRI} data for W/(W + F) and for T2 values (total and focal values) for the symptomatic and contralateral hips. The values were significantly higher in the study group. Statistically significant correlations were found between pain and total W/(W + F), pain and focal T2 values, and the number of microfractures and calculated {BME} for the focal W/(W + F) in the proximal femora. Statistically significant correlations were found between the radiographic findings and {MRI} values for total W/(W + F), focal W/(W + F) and focal T2 and among the radiographic findings, pain, and hip movement. On histopathology, only a small amount of {BME} was seen in eight proximal femora. {CONCLUSION}: The amount of {BME} in the {OA} hip, as measured by {MRI}, correlates with the severity of pain, radiographic findings, and number of microfractures.},

	abstract = {Résumé Le cartilage articulaire normal est un tissu hautement spécialisé, caractérisé par ses propriétés mécaniques. Interposé entre deux surfaces osseuses, il permet, par ses propriétés de résistance aux forces de compression et d’élasticité, le glissement de ces surfaces osseuses grâce à un coefficient de friction extrêmement faible. Le cartilage est un tissu sans vascularisation et sans innervation. Il se nourrit à partir de molécules présentes dans le liquide synovial et qui pénètrent la surface du cartilage. Le cartilage normal est composé d’un seul type de cellules, les chondrocytes, et d’une matrice extracellulaire. Le renouvellement de cette matrice est très lent et les chondrocytes sont à l’état normal des cellules quiescentes qui ne se divisent que très peu. La matrice extracellulaire située à distance de la cellule est organisée en un réseau dense de fibres de collagène de type {II} enchevêtrées entre elles (qui est un marqueur du caractère différencié du chondrocyte) et dont la disposition varie de la superficie à la profondeur. Au sein de ce réseau de collagène de type {II}, des macroagrégats de protéoglycanes hydrophiles sont emprisonnés. Les fibres de collagène sont ainsi mises sous tension par les protéoglycanes chargés en molécules d’eau. Les pressions cycliques auxquelles le cartilage est soumis entraînent des mouvements de ces molécules d‘eau au sein de la matrice. La matrice extracellulaire est stabilisée par des glycoprotéines et des petits protéoglycanes dont une des fonctions est d’attacher les molécules entre elles. Dans la périphérie immédiate du chondrocyte, il existe une atmosphère à {pH} acide, riche en molécules de pontage qui s’amarrent d’un côté sur des récepteurs membranaires et de l’autre sur les molécules matricielles. Parmi ces récepteurs membranaires, les intégrines fonctionnent comme des mécanorécepteurs indispensables aux fonctions de survie de la cellule. Un changement de ces intégrines et/ou de l’environnement péricellulaire entraîne des modifications d’abord métaboliques puis phénotypiques du chondrocyte. En vieillissant, il existe des remaniements du cartilage principalement marqués par une diminution du nombre de chondrocytes et par des modifications qualitatives et quantitatives des protéoglycanes. Surtout, ce cartilage sénescent démontre une moins bonne résistance aux stress mécaniques, ce qui fait le lit potentiel d’une arthrose. Les liens qui unissent vieillissement du cartilage et maladie arthrosique sont étroits. Les causes qui expliquent la diminution de la résistance au stress mécanique sont multiples. L’augmentation de l’apoptose pourrait résulter des changements péricellulaires et favoriser l’arthrose. La fonction principale du cartilage articulaire est de permettre le mouvement d’une articulation qu’elle soit contrainte ou non. Le cartilage recouvre les épiphyses osseuses et peut être assimilé à une sorte d’amortisseur avec un coefficient de friction très faible et une résistance aux forces de compression élevée. The normal joint cartilage is a highly specialized tissue, characterized by its mechanical properties. It is located between two bone surfaces, and due to its capacity of resistance to compression and elasticity forces and its very low friction coefficient, it helps sliding movements of these bone surfaces. The cartilage is a tissue free of any vascularization and innervation, which lives on some molecules from the synovial fluid that penetrate the cartilage surface. The normal cartilage is constituted by a single type of cells, the chondrocytes, and an extracellular matrix. The renewal of this matrix is a very slow process, and normal chondrocytes are quiescent cells that barely divide. The extracellular matrix is located far from the cell and consists of a condensed network of type {II} collagen tangled fibres (marker of the differentiated character of the chondrocyte) of which the disposition vary from surface to depth. Macroaggregates of hydrophilic proteoglycans are imprisoned in this network, so the collagen fibres are put on the water-loaded proteoglycans pressure. The cyclic pressures imposed to the cartilage induce movements of these molecules of water inside the matrix. The extracellular matrix is stabilized both by the glycoproteins and by small proteoglycans of whom one of the functions is to bind the molecules to each other. Close around the chondrocyte, an acid {pH} atmosphere contains high amounts of bridging molecules, attached on one side to membrane receptors and on the other side to matrix molecules. Among these membrane receptors, the integrins function as mechanoreceptors necessary for cell survival. Any change in such integrins and/ or in the pericellular environment results in metabolic, and then phenotypic modifications of the chondrocyte. With ageing, modifications of the cartilage may occur, mainly with a reduced amount of chondrocytes and with qualitative and quantitative modifications of proteoglycans. Above all, this senescent cartilage reveals a diminished resistance to mechanical stress, which may result in potential osteo-arthritis. A strong relationship exists between the ageing cartilage and the osteo-arthritic disease. Multiple causes may induce diminished resistance to mechanical stress. Increased apoptosis may result from pericellular modifications and promote osteo-arthritis. The main function of the joint cartilage is to favour the joint movement whichever its motivation. The cartilage covers bone epiphyses and may be considered as a damper with a very low coefficient of friction and a very high coefficient of resistance to compression forces.},

In joint diseases, cartilage homeostasis is disrupted by mechanisms that are driven by combinations of biological mediators that vary according to the disease process, including contributions from other joint tissues. In osteoarthritis ({OA}), biomechanical stimuli predominate with up-regulation of both catabolic and anabolic cytokines and recapitulation of developmental phenotypes, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}), inflammation and catabolism drive cartilage loss. In vitro studies in chondrocytes have elucidated signaling pathways and transcription factors that orchestrate specific functions that promote cartilage damage in both {OA} and {RA}. Thus, understanding how the adult articular chondrocyte functions within its unique environment will aid in the development of rational strategies to protect cartilage from damage resulting from joint disease.

Bik1 forms a complex with the kinesin Kip2. Fluorescently labeled Bik1 and Kip2 comigrate along individual microtubules. Bik1 exists in distinct intracellular pools: a stable pool at the spindle pole body that is depleted during cell cycle progression, a soluble pool from which Bik1 can be recruited during microtubule initiation, and a dynamic plus end pool maintained by Kip2. Kip2 stabilizes microtubules by targeting Bik1 to the plus end and Kip2 levels are controlled during the cell cycle. As with Bik1, the targeting of dynein to the microtubule plus end requires Kip2. These findings reveal a central role for Kip2-dependent transport in the cell cycle control of microtubule dynamics and dynein-dependent motility.},

Such cell-type-specific gene expression profiles in solid, adult tissues would benefit from approaches that avoid cellular stress during isolation. Here, we developed such an approach and identified highly selective transcriptomic signatures in adult mouse striatal direct and indirect spiny projection neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we obtained a comprehensive model for cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression in the mouse striatum. A cross-analysis with transcriptomic and epigenomic data generated from mouse and human Huntington's disease ({HD}) brains shows that opposite epigenetic mechanisms govern the transcriptional regulation of striatal neurons and glial cells and may contribute to pathogenic and compensatory mechanisms. Overall, these data validate this less stressful method for the investigation of cellular specificity in the adult mouse brain and demonstrate the potential of integrative studies using multiple databases.},

In human osteoarthritis ({OA}), chondrocytes can differentiate to a hypertrophic phenotype characterized by type X collagen. The protein- and {mRNA}-expression pattern of {OC} was systematically analyzed in decalcified cartilage and bone sections and nondecalcified cartilage sections of human osteoarthritic knee joints with different stages of {OA} to investigate the differentiation of chondrocytes in {OA}. In severe {OA}, we found an enhanced expression of the {OC} {mRNA} in the subchondral bone plate, demonstrating an increased osteoblast activity. Interestingly, the {OC} protein and {OC} {mRNA} were also detected in osteoarthritic chondrocytes, whereas in chondrocytes of normal adult cartilage, both the protein staining and the specific {mRNA} signal were negative. The {OC} {mRNA} signal increased with the severity of {OA} and chondrocytes from the deep cartilage layer, and proliferating chondrocytes from clusters showed the strongest signal for {OC} {mRNA}. In this late stage of {OA}, chondrocytes also stained for alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen. Our results clearly show that the expression of {OC} in chondrocytes correlates with chondrocyte hypertrophy in {OA}. Although the factors including this phenotypic shift in {OA} are still unknown, it can be assumed that the altered microenvironment around osteoarthritic chondrocytes and systemic mediators could be potential inducers of this differentiation.},

Our data showed profound changes in skeletal shape, size and structure when Bmpr1a was deleted using Aggrecan-Cre {ERT}2 in early cartilage cells with a one-time tamoxifen injection. We observed the absence of lineage progression of chondrocyte-derived bone cells to form osteoblasts and osteocytes in metaphyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated the key contribution of growth plate chondrocytes and articular chondrocytes, not only for long bone growth, but also for bone remodeling. In contrast, deleting Bmpr1a in early osteoblasts with 3.6 Col 1-Cre had little impact on skeletal shape and size except for a sharp increase in osteoblasts and osteocytes, leading to a profound increase in bone volume. We conclude that chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are one continuous developmental and lineage-defined biological process, in which Bmpr1a signaling in chondrocytes is necessary for the formation of a pool or niche of osteoprogenitors that then contributes in a major way to overall bone formation and growth.},

Here, we describe β{III}-tubulin immunohistochemical staining patterns of prostate tumors obtained from a broad spectrum of {PCa} patients, some of whom subsequently received docetaxel therapy for castration-resistant {PCa} ({CRPC}). Elevated β{III}-tubulin expression was significantly associated with tumor aggressiveness in {PCa} patients with presumed localized disease, as it was found to be an independent marker of biochemical recurrence after treatment. Additionally, β{III}-tubulin expression in tumor cells was an independent predictor of lower overall survival for patients receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for {CRPC}. Manipulation of β{III}-tubulin expression in human {PCa} cell lines using a human β{III}-tubulin expression vector or β{III}-tubulin small interfering {RNA} altered cell survival in response to docetaxel treatment in a manner that supports a role for β{III}-tubulin expression as a mediator of {PCa} cell resistance to docetaxel therapy.

Primary {hMSCs} were successfully immortalized ({\textbackslash}textgreater280 {PD}) and further transduced with the {iCasp}9 device. A clone was selected and shown to maintain typical properties of primary {hMSCs}, including phenotype, differentiation and immunomodulation capacities.

Cells could be efficiently induced toward apoptosis ({\textbackslash}textgreater95\%) both in vitro and in vivo. By combining the opposite concepts of 'induced-life' and 'inducible-death', we generated a {hMSCs} line with defined properties and allowing for temporally controlled survival.

However, even in cells with a radial microtubule system, many microtubules are not anchored at the centrosome, but are instead linked to the Golgi apparatus or other structures. Non-centrosomal microtubules predominate in many types of differentiated cell and in mitotic spindles. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how the organization of centrosomal and non-centrosomal microtubule networks is controlled by proteins involved in microtubule nucleation and specific factors that recognize free microtubule minus ends and regulate their localization and dynamics.},

Two authors independently retrieved articles and assessed study quality. {RESULTS}: A total of 21 studies (466 patients) correlated histological features to {SBAs} in {OA} (n = 13), {RA} (n = 3), ankylosing spondylitis ({AS}) (n = 1) and {DDD} (n = 4). Reported changes in {OA} were substitution of normal subchondral bone with fibrosis and necrosis, and increased bone remodeling. In contrast, in {RA}, {AS} or {DDD} fibrosis was not reported and {SBAs} correlated to an increase in inflammatory cell number. In {DDD} necrosis was observed. Similar to {OA}, increased bone remodeling was shown in {RA} and {DDD}. The risk of bias assessment showed a lack in described patient criteria, blinding and/or adequate topographic correlation in approximately half of studies.

	abstract = {The study offers a pharmacological solution to the challenging target of inducing stable chondrogenesis by human mesenchymal stromal cells ({hMSCs}), including protection against vascularization. Cells were reversed from the tendency to follow the default differentiation pathway, namely endochondral ossification and osteogenesis. Our findings open perspectives in articular cartilage regeneration, as well as in the establishment of {hMSC}-based models of cartilage development, physiology, and possibly pathology. Importantly, the results were achieved by mimicking molecular processes occurring during embryonic cartilage formation. This indicates that adult {hMSCs} share similarities with embryonic mesenchyme and validates the relevance to engineer developmental processes (“developmental engineering”) to control fate specification by adult stem/progenitor cell systems., It is generally accepted that adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ({hMSCs}) are default committed toward osteogenesis. Even when induced to chondrogenesis, {hMSCs} typically form hypertrophic cartilage that undergoes endochondral ossification. Because embryonic mesenchyme is obviously competent to generate phenotypically stable cartilage, it is questioned whether there is a correspondence between mesenchymal progenitor compartments during development and in adulthood. Here we tested whether forcing specific early events of articular cartilage development can program {hMSC} fate toward stable chondrogenesis. Inspired by recent findings that spatial restriction of bone morphogenetic protein ({BMP}) signaling guides embryonic progenitors toward articular cartilage formation, we hypothesized that selective inhibition of {BMP} drives the phenotypic stability of {hMSC}-derived chondrocytes. Two {BMP} type I receptor-biased kinase inhibitors were screened in a microfluidic platform for their time- and dose-dependent effect on {hMSC} chondrogenesis. The different receptor selectivity profile of tested compounds allowed demonstration that transient blockade of both {ALK}2 and {ALK}3 receptors, while permissive to {hMSC} cartilage formation, is necessary and sufficient to maintain a stable chondrocyte phenotype. Remarkably, even upon compound removal, {hMSCs} were no longer competent to undergo hypertrophy in vitro and endochondral ossification in vivo, indicating the onset of a constitutive change. Our findings demonstrate that adult {hMSCs} effectively share properties of embryonic mesenchyme in the formation of transient but also of stable cartilage. This opens potential pharmacological strategies to articular cartilage regeneration and more broadly indicates the relevance of developmentally inspired protocols to control the fate of adult progenitor cell systems.},

In contrast, adipocytes with deletions of both {DGATs} were severely lacking in {TG} and did not have {LDs}, indicating that {DGAT}1 and {DGAT}2 account for nearly all {TG} synthesis in adipocytes and appear to be required for {LD} formation during adipogenesis. {DGAT} enzymes were not absolutely required for {LD} formation in mammalian cells, however; macrophages deficient in both {DGAT} enzymes were able to form {LDs} when incubated with cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Although adipocytes lacking both {DGATs} had no {TG} or {LDs}, they were fully differentiated by multiple criteria. Our findings show that {DGAT}1 and {DGAT}2 account for the vast majority of {TG} synthesis in mice, and {DGAT} function is required for {LDs} in adipocytes, but not in all cell types.},

	doi = {10.1074/jbc.M110.212878},
	abstract = {The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein ({LRP}1) is a transmembrane receptor that integrates multiple signaling pathways. Its cytoplasmic domain serves as docking sites for several adaptor proteins such as the Src homology 2/α-collagen ({ShcA}), which also binds to several tyrosine kinase receptors such as the insulin-like growth factor 1 ({IGF}-1) receptor. However, the physiological significance of the physical interaction between {LRP}1 and {ShcA}, and whether this interaction modifies tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, are still unknown. Here we report that {LRP}1 forms a complex with the {IGF}-1 receptor, and that {LRP}1 is required for {ShcA} to become sensitive to {IGF}-1 stimulation. Upon {IGF}-1 treatment, {ShcA} is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocates to the plasma membrane only in the presence of {LRP}1. This leads to the recruitment of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) to {ShcA}, and activation of the Ras/{MAP} kinase pathway. Conversely, in the absence of {ShcA}, {IGF}-1 signaling bifurcates toward the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and accelerates adipocyte differentiation when cells are stimulated for adipogenesis. These results establish the {LRP}1-{ShcA} complex as an essential component in the {IGF}-1-regulated pathway for {MAP} kinase and Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin activation, and may help to understand the {IGF}-1 signaling shift from clonal expansion to growth-arrested cells and differentiation during adipogenesis.},

The existing journals, with their well-tested functionalities, should be retained and developed to meet the demands of 21st century research, while the underlying payment streams undergo a major restructuring. There is sufficient momentum for this decisive push towards open access publishing. The diverse existing initiatives must be coordinated so as to converge on this clear goal. The international nature of research implies that this transformation will be achieved on a truly global scale only through a consensus of the world’s most eminent research organizations. All the indications are that the money already invested in the research publishing system is sufficient to enable a transformation that will be sustainable for the future. There needs to be a shared understanding that the money currently locked in the journal subscription system must be withdrawn and repurposed for open access publishing services. The current library acquisition budgets are the ultimate reservoir for enabling the transformation without financial or other risks. The goal is to preserve the established service levels provided by publishers that are still requested by researchers, while redefining and reorganizing the necessary payment streams. By disrupting the underlying business model, the viability of journal publishing can be preserved and put on a solid footing for the scholarly developments of the future.},

As such, there is a wide variety of compounds currently in clinical use and in development that act as antimitotic agents by altering microtubule dynamics. Although these diverse molecules are known to affect microtubule dynamics upon binding to one of the three established drug domains (taxane, vinca alkaloid, or colchicine site), the exact mechanism by which each drug works is still an area of intense speculation and research. In this study, we review the effects of microtubule-binding chemotherapeutic agents from a new perspective, considering how their mode of binding induces conformational changes and alters biological function relative to the molecular vectors of microtubule assembly or disassembly. These “biological vectors” can thus be used as a spatiotemporal context to describe molecular mechanisms by which microtubule-targeting drugs work.},

Cytoplasmic linker protein 170 ({CLIP}-170), the prototype +{TIP}, was proposed to bind to {MT} ends with high affinity, possibly by copolymerization with tubulin, and to dissociate seconds later. However, using fluorescence-based approaches, we show that two +{TIPs}, {CLIP}-170 and end-binding protein 3 ({EB}3), turn over rapidly on {MT} ends. Diffusion of {CLIP}-170 and {EB}3 appears to be rate limiting for their binding to {MT} plus ends. We also report that the ends of growing {MTs} contain a surplus of sites to which {CLIP}-170 binds with relatively low affinity.

Here, I review the canonical explanation of dynamic instability that was fleshed out in the years after its discovery. Many aspects of this explanation have been recently subverted, particularly those related to how {GTP}-tubulin forms polymers and why {GTP} hydrolysis disrupts them.

This is achieved by attaching the ends of microtubules to cellular structures; as the microtubules grow and shrink, the structures are pushed or pulled around the cell. How do the ends of microtubules couple to cellular structures, and how does this coupling regulate the stability and distribution of the microtubules? It is now clear that there are at least three properties of a microtubule end: it has alternate structures; it has a biochemical transition defined by {GTP} hydrolysis; and it forms a distinct target for the binding of specific proteins. These different properties can be unified by thinking of the microtubule as a molecular machine, which switches between growing and shrinking modes. Each mode is associated with a specific end structure on which end-binding proteins can assemble to modulate dynamics and couple the dynamic properties of microtubules to the movement of cellular structures.},

We conclude that Dex induces Runx2 expression by {FHL}2/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation and that Dex enhances Runx2 activity by upregulation of {TAZ} and {MKP}1. Asc leads to the increased secretion of collagen type I (Col1), which in turn leads to increased Col1/α2β1 integrin-mediated intracellular signaling. The phosphate from β-Gly serves as a source for the phosphate in hydroxylapatite and in addition influences intracellular signaling molecules.

We review the evidence of the editorial peer-review process of original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in biomedical journals. {OBJECTIVES}: To estimate the effect of processes in editorial peer review. {SEARCH} {STRATEGY}: The following databases were searched to June 2004: {CINAHL}, Ovid, Cochrane Methodology Register, Dissertation abstracts, {EMBASE}, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews: {ACP} Journal Club, {MEDLINE}, {PsycINFO}, {PubMed}. {SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: We included prospective or retrospective comparative studies with two or more comparison groups, generated by random or other appropriate methods, and reporting original research, regardless of publication status. We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting. {DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Because of the diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods, and outcomes, we carried out a descriptive review of included studies grouping them by broad study question. {MAIN} {RESULTS}: We included 28 studies. We found no clear-cut evidence of effect of the well-researched practice of reviewer and/or author concealment on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9 studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have some evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of the outcome (1 study). Different methods of communicating with reviewers and means of dissemination do not appear to have an effect on quality (3 studies). On the basis of one study, little can be said about the ability of the peer-review process to detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of peer review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area. Editorial peer review appears to make papers more readable and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence for this has very limited generalisability. {AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: At present, little empirical evidence is available to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research. However, the methodological problems in studying peer review are many and complex. At present, the absence of evidence on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be interpreted as evidence of their absence. A large, well-funded programme of research on the effects of editorial peer review should be urgently launched.},

	abstract = {Embryonic development, lengthening, and repair of most bones proceed by endochondral ossification, namely through formation of a cartilage intermediate. It was previously demonstrated that adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ({hMSCs}) can execute an endochondral program and ectopically generate mature bone. Here we hypothesized that {hMSCs} pushed through endochondral ossification can engineer a scaled-up ossicle with features of a "bone organ," including physiologically remodeled bone, mature vasculature, and a fully functional hematopoietic compartment. Engineered hypertrophic cartilage required {IL}-1β to be efficiently remodeled into bone and bone marrow upon subcutaneous implantation. This model allowed distinguishing, by analogy with bone development and repair, an outer, cortical-like perichondral bone, generated mainly by host cells and laid over a premineralized area, and an inner, trabecular-like, endochondral bone, generated mainly by the human cells and formed over the cartilaginous template. Hypertrophic cartilage remodeling was paralleled by ingrowth of blood vessels, displaying sinusoid-like structures and stabilized by pericytic cells. Marrow cavities of the ossicles contained phenotypically defined hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells at similar frequencies as native bones, and marrow from ossicles reconstituted multilineage long-term hematopoiesis in lethally irradiated mice. This study, by invoking a "developmental engineering" paradigm, reports the generation by appropriately instructed {hMSC} of an ectopic "bone organ" with a size, structure, and functionality comparable to native bones. The work thus provides a model useful for fundamental and translational studies of bone morphogenesis and regeneration, as well as for the controlled manipulation of hematopoietic stem cell niches in physiology and pathology.},

	abstract = {Chondrocytes in the epiphyseal cartilage undergo terminal differentiation prior to their removal through apoptosis. To examine the role of {ERK}1 and {ERK}2 in chondrocyte terminal differentiation, we generated Osterix (Osx)-Cre; {ERK}1(-/-) ; {ERK}2(flox/flox) mice (conditional knockout Osx [{cKOosx}]), in which {ERK}1 and {ERK}2 were deleted in hypertrophic chondrocytes. These {cKOosx} mice were grossly normal in size at birth, but by 3 weeks of age exhibited shorter long bones. Histological analysis in these mice revealed that the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate was markedly expanded. In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time {PCR} analyses demonstrated that Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (Mmp13) and Osteopontin expression was significantly decreased, indicating impaired chondrocyte terminal differentiation. Moreover, Egr1 and Egr2, transcription factors whose expression is restricted to the last layers of hypertrophic chondrocytes in wild-type mice, were also strongly downregulated in these {cKOosx} mice. In transient transfection experiments in the {RCS} rat chondrosarcoma cell line, the expression of Egr1, Egr2, or a constitutively active mutant of {MEK}1 increased the activity of an Osteopontin promoter, whereas the {MEK}1-induced activation of the Osteopontin promoter was inhibited by the coexpression of Nab2, an Egr1 and Egr2 co-repressor. These results suggest that {MEK}1-{ERK} signaling activates the Osteopontin promoter in part through Egr1 and Egr2. Finally, our histological analysis of {cKOosx} mice demonstrated enchondroma-like lesions in the bone marrow that are reminiscent of human metachondromatosis, a skeletal disorder caused by mutations in {PTPN}11. Our observations suggest that the development of enchondromas in metachondromatosis may be caused by reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ({ERK} {MAPK}) signaling.},

	abstract = {Microtubules ({MTs}) serve important roles in cell trafficking, division and signaling. {MTs} polymerize via net addition of {GTP}-tubulin subunits to the {MT} plus end, which subsequently hydrolyze to {GDP}-tubulin after incorporation into the {MT} lattice. The relatively stable {GTP}-tubulin subunits create a “{GTP} cap” at the growing {MT} plus end that protects the {MT} from catastrophe. Therefore, to understand {MT} assembly regulation we need to understand {GTP} hydrolysis reaction kinetics and the size of the {GTP} cap. In vitro, the {GTP} cap has been estimated to be as small as one layer [-](13 subunits) or as large as 100-200 subunits []. {GTP} cap size estimates in vivo have not yet been reported. Using {EB}1-{EGFP} as a marker for {GTP}-tubulin in {LLCPK}1 epithelial cells, we find on average: (1) 270 {EB}1 dimers bound to growing {MT} plus ends, and (2) a {GTP} cap size of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde750 tubulin subunits. Thus, in vivo, the {GTP} cap size is far larger than previous estimates in vitro, and {\textbackslash}textasciitilde60-fold larger than a single layer cap. Consistent with these findings, we also find the tail region of a large {GTP} cap, 0.5-2.0 μm from the tip, promotes {MT} rescue and suppresses shortening. We speculate that a large {GTP} cap provides a locally concentrated ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde100 μM) scaffold for tip-tracking proteins, and confers persistence to assembly in the face of physical barriers such as the cell cortex.},

To minimize off-target cleavage, we further describe a double-nicking strategy using the Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide {RNAs}. This protocol provides experimentally derived guidelines for the selection of target sites, evaluation of cleavage efficiency and analysis of off-target activity.

Gold {OAP} is a common form of {OAP} where the author pays an article processing charge ({APC}) to make the article freely available to readers. However, gold {OAP} is a cause for concern because it drives a redistribution of valuable research money to support open access papers in ‘mega-journals’ with more permissive acceptance criteria. We present a data-driven evaluation of the ﬁnancial ramiﬁcations of gold {OAP} and provide evidence that gold {OAP} in mega-journals is biased toward Western industrialized countries. From 2011 to 2015, the period of our data collection, countries with developing economies had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in the lower-tier mega-journals and thus paid article {APCs} that cross-subsidize publications in the top-tier journals of the same publisher. Conversely, scientists from Western developed countries had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in those same top-tier journals. The global inequity of the cross-subsidizing {APC} model was demonstrated across ﬁve different mega-journals, showing that the issue is a common problem. We need to develop stringent and fair criteria that address the global ﬁnancial implications of {OAP}, as publication fees should reﬂect the real cost of publishing and be transparent for authors.},

This behavior is driven by {GTP} hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice, and is inhibited by anticancer agents like Taxol. We provide new insight into the mechanism of dynamic instability, based on high-resolution cryo-{EM} structures (4.7–5.6 Å) of dynamic microtubules and microtubules stabilized by {GMPCPP} or Taxol. We infer that hydrolysis leads to a compaction around the E-site nucleotide at longitudinal interfaces, as well as movement of the α–tubulin intermediate domain and H7 helix. Displacement of the C-terminal helices in both α– and β–tubulin subunits suggests an effect on interactions with binding partners that contact this region. Taxol inhibits most of these conformational changes, allosterically inducing a {GMPCPP}-like state. Lateral interactions are similar in all conditions we examined, suggesting that microtubule lattice stability is primarily modulated at longitudinal interfaces.},

	abstract = {{HTRF} (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence) is the most frequently used generic assay technology to measure analytes in a homogenous format, which is the ideal platform used for drug target studies in high-throughput screening ({HTS}). This technology combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology ({FRET}) with time-resolved measurement ({TR}). In {TR}-{FRET} assays, a signal is generated through fluorescent resonance energy transfer between a donor and an acceptor molecule when in close proximity to each other. Buffer and media interference is dramatically reduced by dual-wavelength detection, and the final signal is proportional to the extent of product formation. The {HTRF} assay is usually sensitive and robust that can be miniaturized into the 384 and 1536-well plate formats. This assay technology has been applied to many antibody-based assays including {GPCR} signaling ({cAMP} and {IP}-One), kinases, cytokines and biomarkers, bioprocess (antibody and protein production), as well as the assays for protein-protein, proteinpeptide, and protein-{DNA}/{RNA} interactions., Since its introduction to the drug-screening world over ten years ago, researchers have used {HTRF} to expedite the study of {GPCRs}, kinases, new biomarkers, protein-protein interactions, and other targets of interest. {HTRF} has also been utilized as an alternative method for bioprocess monitoring. The first-generation {HTRF} technology, which uses Europium cryptate as a fluorescence donor to monitor reactions between biomolecules, was extended in 2008 through the introduction of a second-generation donor, Terbium cryptate (Tb), enhancing screening performance. Terbium cryptate possesses different photophysical properties compared to Europium, including increased quantum yield and a higher molar extinction coefficient. In addition to being compatible with the same acceptor fluorophors used with Europium, it can serve as a donor fluorophore to green-emitting fluors because it has multiple emission peaks including one at 490 nm. Moreover, all Terbium {HTRF} assays can be read on the same {HTRF}-compatible instruments as Europium {HTRF} assays., Overall, {HTRF} is a highly sensitive, robust technology for the detection of molecular interactions in vitro and is widely used for primary and secondary screening phases of drug development. This review addresses the general principles of {HTRF} and its current applications in drug discovery.},

In endochondral bone formation, chondrocytes undergo a series of differentiation steps to form the growth plate, and it generally is accepted that death is the ultimate fate of terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes ({HCs}). Osteoblasts, accompanying vascular invasion, lay down endochondral bone to replace cartilage. However, whether an {HC} can become an osteoblast and contribute to the full osteogenic lineage has been the subject of a century-long debate. Here we use a cell-specific tamoxifen-inducible genetic recombination approach to track the fate of murine {HCs} and show that they can survive the cartilage-to-bone transition and become osteogenic cells in fetal and postnatal endochondral bones and persist into adulthood. This discovery of a chondrocyte-to-osteoblast lineage continuum revises concepts of the ontogeny of osteoblasts, with implications for the control of bone homeostasis and the interpretation of the underlying pathological bases of bone disorders.},

	abstract = {Plasmid {DNA} containing the human beta-interferon ({IFN}-beta) gene and mouse dihydrofolate reductase {cDNA} was transfected into dihydrofolate reductase-negative Chinese hamster ovary cells. Dihydrofolate reductase-positive transformants were obtained, and cells containing amplified copies of mouse dihydrofolate reductase were selected by exposure to increasing methotrexate concentrations. These cells were found to express high levels of human {IFN}-beta after polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid superinduction or {NDV} infection; this was a result of coamplification of the {IFN}-beta gene. Levels of expression of 1 U/cell per day were achieved on superinduction, giving corresponding titers of up to 10(10) U/liter medium in culture supernatants. Constitutive production of {IFN}-beta rates of about 0.5\% of superinduced rates was observed; cells producing these levels of {IFN}-beta had acquired resistance to cytotoxic antiviral effects of {IFN}-beta. Two forms of human {IFN}-beta were produced; a major glycosylated 23,000-dalton form and an unglycosylated 18,500-dalton form. The latter had greatly reduced antiviral activity. {IFN}-beta production was very sensitive to cellular growth rate; the highest levels were produced by density-arrested cultures. Regulation of {IFN}-beta production by polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid or by cell density effects required the presence of {DNA} sequences 5' to the {IFN}-beta-coding sequences; replacement of these sequences with the simian virus 40 early promoter resulted in uninducible, density-independent production of {IFN}-beta.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a highly prevalent and debilitating joint disorder. There is no effective medical therapy for the condition because of limited understanding of its pathogenesis. We show that transforming growth factor β1 ({TGF}-β1) is activated in subchondral bone in response to altered mechanical loading in an anterior cruciate ligament transection ({ACLT}) mouse model of osteoarthritis. {TGF}-β1 concentrations are also high in subchondral bone from humans with osteoarthritis. High concentrations of {TGF}-β1 induced formation of nestin-positive mesenchymal stem cell ({MSC}) clusters, leading to formation of marrow osteoid islets accompanied by high levels of angiogenesis. We found that transgenic expression of active {TGF}-β1 in osteoblastic cells induced osteoarthritis, whereas inhibition of {TGF}-β activity in subchondral bone attenuated the degeneration of articular cartilage. In particular, knockout of the {TGF}-β type {II} receptor ({TβRII}) in nestin-positive {MSCs} led to less development of osteoarthritis relative to wild-type mice after {ACLT}. Thus, high concentrations of active {TGF}-β1 in subchondral bone seem to initiate the pathological changes of osteoarthritis, and inhibition of this process could be a potential therapeutic approach to treating this disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This is a systematic review of studies on the prevalence of osteoarthritis in the tibiofemoral joint more than 10 years after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, the radiologic classification methods used, and risk factors for development of knee osteoarthritis. {METHODS}: A systematic search was performed in {PubMed}, {EMBASE}, and {AMED}. Inclusion criteria were studies involving patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury, either isolated or combined with medial collateral ligament or meniscal injury and either surgically or nonsurgically treated, and a minimum 10-year follow-up with radiologic assessment. Methodological quality was evaluated using a modified version of the Coleman methodology score. {RESULTS}: Seven prospective and 24 retrospective studies were included. The mean modified Coleman methodology score was 52 of 90. Reported prevalence of knee osteoarthritis for subjects with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury was between 0\% and 13\%. For subjects with anterior cruciate ligament and additional meniscal injury, the prevalence varied between 21\% and 48\%. Seven different radiologic classification systems were used in the studies. Only 3 studies reported reliability results for the radiologic assessments. The most frequently reported risk factor for development of knee osteoarthritis was meniscal injury. {CONCLUSION}: This systematic review suggests that the prevalence rates of knee osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction reported by previous reviews have been too high. The highest rated studies reported low prevalence of knee osteoarthritis for individuals with isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury (0\%-13\%) and a higher prevalence of knee osteoarthritis for subjects with combined injuries (21\%-48\%). Overall, the modified Coleman methodology score was low for the included studies. No universal methodological radiologic classification method exists, making comparisons of the studies and stating firm conclusions on the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis more than 10 years after anterior cruciate ligament injury difficult.},

	abstract = {Microtubule dynamics were investigated in {CHO} and {NRK} cells by novel experimental approaches designed to evaluate the microtubule behavior in the cell interior. These approaches were: (1) laser photobleaching of a path through the centrosome; (2) direct observation of microtubules in centrosome-containing cytoplasts; (3) {GFP}-{CLIP}-170 expression as a marker for microtubule plus end growth; and (iv) sequential subtraction analysis. The combination of these approaches allowed us to obtain data where the density of microtubules had previously prevented conventional methods to be applicable. In the steady state, nascent microtubules grew persistently from the centrosome towards the cell margin. Frequently, they arrived at the cell margin without undergoing any transition to the shortening phase. In contrast to the growth of microtubules, shortening of the plus ends from the periphery was non-persistent; that is, rescue was frequent and the extent of shortening showed a distribution of lengths reflecting a stochastic process. The combination of persistent growth and a cell boundary led to a difference in apparent microtubule behavior in the cell interior compared with that near the cell margin. Whereas microtubules in the cell interior showed asymmetric transition frequencies, their behavior near the cell margin showed frequent fluctuations between phases of shortening and growth. Complete microtubule turnover was accomplished by the relatively rare episodes of shortening back to the centrosome. Release from the centrosome with subsequent minus end shortening also occurred but was a minor mechanism for microtubule turnover compared with the plus end pathway. We propose a life cycle for a microtubule which consists of rapid growth from the centrosome to the cell margin followed by an indefinite period of fluctuations of phases of shortening and growth. We suggest that persistent growth and asymmetric transition frequencies serve the biological function of providing a mechanism by which microtubules may rapidly accommodate to the changing shape and advancing edge of motile cells.},

Here, we examined the role of endothelial {ShcA} in atherosclerotic lesion formation. We found that atherosclerosis progression was markedly attenuated in mice deleted for {ShcA} in endothelial cells, that macrophage content was reduced at the sites of lesions, and that adhesion molecules such as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ({ICAM}-1) were severely reduced. Our data indicate that transcriptional regulation of {ShcA} by the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 ({ZEB}1) and the Hippo pathway effector {YAP}, promotes {ICAM}-1 expression independently of p-{NF}-κB, the primary driver of adhesion molecules expressions. In addition, {ShcA} suppresses endothelial Akt and nitric oxide synthase ({eNOS}) expressions. Thus, through down regulation of {eNOS} and {ZEB}1-mediated {ICAM}-1 up regulation, endothelial {ShcA} promotes monocyte-macrophage adhesion and atherosclerotic lesion formation. Reducing {ShcA} expression in endothelial cells may represent an obvious therapeutic approach to prevent atherosclerosis.},

Each item was scored on a 1 to 5 scale. Forty-four expert assessors unaware of the design or aims of the study evaluated the manuscripts, with different persons evaluating the two versions of each manuscript (before and after the editorial process). {RESULTS}: 33 of the 34 items changed in the direction of improvement, with the largest improvements seen in the discussion of study limitations, generalizations, use of confidence intervals, and the tone of conclusions. Overall, the percentage of items scored three or more increased by an absolute 7.3\% (95\% {CI}, 3.3\% to 11.3\%) from a baseline of 75\%.

However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating Cbfa1 activity. This work examines the role of the {MAPK} pathway in regulating Cbfa1-dependent transcription. Stimulation of {MAPK} by transfecting a constitutively active form of {MEK}1, {MEK}({SP}), into {MC}3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells increased endogenous {OCN} {mRNA}, while a dominant negative mutant, {MEK}({DN}), was inhibitory. {MEK}({SP}) also stimulated activity of a 147-base pair minimal {OCN} promoter, and this stimulation required an intact copy of {OSE}2, the {DNA} binding site for Cbfa1. Effects of {MEK}({SP}) were specific to Cbfa1-positive osteoblast-like cells. A purified His-tagged Cbfa1 fusion protein was directly phosphorylated by activated recombinant {MAPK} in vitro. Furthermore, (32)P metabolic labeling studies demonstrated that {MEK}({SP}) clearly enhanced phosphorylation of Cbfa1 in intact cells, while {MEK}({DN}) decreased phosphorylation. The specific {MEK}1/{MEK}2 inhibitor, {PD}98059, inhibited extracellular matrix-dependent up-regulation of the {OCN} promoter, indicating that the {MAPK} pathway and, presumably, Cbfa1 phosphorylation are also required for responsiveness of osteoblasts to extracellular matrix signals. This study is the first demonstration that Cbfa1 is controlled by {MAPKs} and suggests that this pathway has an important role in the control of osteoblast-specific gene expression.},

	abstract = {Microtubules are key players in cellular self-organization, acting as structural scaffolds, cellular highways, force generators and signalling platforms. Microtubules are polar filaments that undergo dynamic instability, i.e. transition between phases of growth and shrinkage. This allows microtubules to explore the inner space of the cell, generate pushing and pulling forces and remodel themselves into arrays with different geometry and function such as the mitotic spindle. To do this, eukaryotic cells employ an arsenal of regulatory proteins to control microtubule dynamics spatially and temporally. Plants and microorganisms have developed secondary metabolites that perturb microtubule dynamics, many of which are in active use as cancer chemotherapeutics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Here, we summarize the methods used to visualize microtubules and to measure the parameters of dynamic instability to study both microtubule regulatory proteins and the action of small molecules interfering with microtubule assembly and/or disassembly.},

We report six cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-{EM}) structures of {MTs}, at 3.5 Å or better resolution, bound to {GMPCPP}, {GTPγS}, or {GDP}, either decorated with kinesin motor domain after polymerization or copolymerized with {EB}3. Subtle changes around the E-site nucleotide during hydrolysis trigger conformational changes in α-tubulin around an "anchor point," leading to global lattice rearrangements and strain generation. Unlike the extended lattice of the {GMPCPP}-{MT}, the {EB}3-bound {GTPγS}-{MT} has a compacted lattice that differs in lattice twist from that of the also compacted {GDP}-{MT}. These results and the observation that {EB}3 promotes rapid hydrolysis of {GMPCPP} suggest that {EB} proteins modulate structural transitions at growing {MT} ends by recognizing and promoting an intermediate state generated during {GTP} hydrolysis.

Participants were assessed for pain (using Western Ontario and {McMaster} Universities Osteoarthritis Index ({WOMAC})) and with a knee {MRI} (using {MOAKS}). Tissue was then harvested at {TKR} for {BML} analysis using histology and tissue microarray. {RESULTS}: The mean ({SD}) {WOMAC} pain scores were significantly increased in advanced {OA} 59.4 (21.3) and mild {OA} 30.9 (20.3) compared with controls 0.5 (1.28) (p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001). {MOAKS} showed all {TKR} tissue analysed had {BMLs}, and within these lesions, bone marrow volume was starkly reduced being replaced by dense fibrous connective tissue, new blood vessels, hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The labile nature of microtubules is critical for establishing cellular morphology and motility, yet the molecular basis of assembly remains unclear. Here we use optical tweezers to track microtubule polymerization against microfabricated barriers, permitting unprecedented spatial resolution. {RESULTS}: We find that microtubules exhibit extensive nanometer-scale variability in growth rate and often undergo shortening excursions, in some cases exceeding five tubulin layers, during periods of overall net growth. This result indicates that the guanosine triphosphate ({GTP}) cap does not exist as a single layer as previously proposed. We also find that length increments (over 100 ms time intervals, n = 16,762) are small, 0.81 +/- 6.60 nm (mean +/- standard deviation), and very rarely exceed 16 nm (about two dimer lengths), indicating that assembly occurs almost exclusively via single-subunit addition rather than via oligomers as was recently suggested. Finally, the assembly rate depends only weakly on load, with the average growth rate decreasing only 2-fold as the force increases 7-fold from 0.4 {pN} to 2.8 {pN}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The data are consistent with a mechanochemical model in which a spatially extended {GTP} cap allows substantial shortening on the nanoscale, while still preventing complete catastrophe in most cases.},

The phases can be synchronized, leading to bulk oscillations of microtubules. To study the structural basis of dynamic instability we have examined growing, shrinking, and oscillating microtubules by time-resolved cryo-{EM}. In particular we have addressed three questions which are currently a matter of debate: (a) What is the relationship between microtubules, tubulin subunits, and tubulin oligomers in microtubule dynamics?; (b) How do microtubules shrink? By release of subunits or via oligomers?; and (c) Is there a conformational change at microtubule ends during the transitions from growth to shrinkage and vice versa? The results show that (a) oscillating microtubules coexist with a substantial fraction of oligomers, even at a maximum of microtubule assembly; (b) microtubules disassemble primarily into oligomers; and (c) the ends of growing microtubules have straight protofilaments, shrinking microtubules have protofilaments coiled inside out. This is interpreted as a transition from a tense to a relaxed conformation which could be used to perform work, as suggested by some models of poleward chromosome movement during anaphase.},

A key challenge is connecting together the vast range of relevant length-time scales, events happening at time scales ranging from nanoseconds, such as tubulin molecular interactions (Å-nm), to minutes-hours, such as the cellular response to microtubule dynamics during mitotic progression (μm). At the same time, microtubule interactions with associated proteins and binding agents, such as anti-cancer drugs, can strongly affect this dynamic process through atomic-level mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. New high-resolution technologies for investigating these interactions, including cryo-electron microscopy ({EM}) techniques and total internal reflection fluorescence ({TIRF}) microscopy, are yielding important new insights. Here, we focus on recent studies of microtubule dynamics, both theoretical and experimental, and how these findings shed new light on this complex phenomenon across length-time scales, from Å to μm and from nanoseconds to minutes.},

We measured considerable time lags between the arrival of tubulin and the onset of steady-state elongation. Microtubule-associated proteins ({MAPs}) alter these time lags. Catastrophe factors ({MCAK} and {EB}1) inhibited nucleation, whereas a polymerase ({XMAP}215) and an anti-catastrophe factor ({TPX}2) promoted nucleation. We observed similar phenomena in cells.

Histology of the proximal tibia at the end of the study was compared with the last {MR} imaging findings. In five adult dogs, the left cranial cruciate ligament was transected. Post-operatively, {MR} imaging was performed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 13 months. Dogs were euthanised after 13 months and histological specimen of the proximal tibia were evaluated. Bone marrow edema like {MR} imaging signal changes were seen in every {MR} examination of all dogs in one or more locations of the proximal tibia and the distal femur. Lesions varied in size and location throughout the whole study with the exception of constantly seen lesions in the epiphyseal and metaphyseal region at the level of the tibial eminence. On histology, hematopoiesis and myxomatous transformation of the bone marrow and/or intertrabecular fibrosis without signs of bone marrow edema were consistent findings in the areas corresponding to the {MR} imaging signal changes. We conclude that within the bone marrow, zones of increased signal intensity on fat suppressed {MR} images do not necessarily represent edema but can be due to cellular infiltration.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Articular cartilage injuries have poor repair capacity, leading to progressive joint damage, and cannot be restored predictably by either conventional treatments or advanced therapies based on implantation of articular chondrocytes. Compared with articular chondrocytes, chondrocytes derived from the nasal septum have superior and more reproducible capacity to generate hyaline-like cartilage tissues, with the plasticity to adapt to a joint environment. We aimed to assess whether engineered autologous nasal chondrocyte-based cartilage grafts allow safe and functional restoration of knee cartilage defects. {METHODS}: In a first-in-human trial, ten patients with symptomatic, post-traumatic, full-thickness cartilage lesions (2-6 cm2) on the femoral condyle or trochlea were treated at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Chondrocytes isolated from a 6 mm nasal septum biopsy specimen were expanded and cultured onto collagen membranes to engineer cartilage grafts (30 × 40 × 2 mm). The engineered tissues were implanted into the femoral defects via mini-arthrotomy and assessed up to 24 months after surgery. Primary outcomes were feasibility and safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included self-assessed clinical scores and {MRI}-based estimation of morphological and compositional quality of the repair tissue. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01605201. The study is ongoing, with an approved extension to 25 patients. {FINDINGS}: For every patient, it was feasible to manufacture cartilaginous grafts with nasal chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix rich in glycosaminoglycan and type {II} collagen. Engineered tissues were stable through handling with forceps and could be secured in the injured joints. No adverse reactions were recorded and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, knee function, and quality of life were improved significantly from before surgery to 24 months after surgery. Radiological assessments indicated variable degrees of defect filling and development of repair tissue approaching the composition of native cartilage. {INTERPRETATION}: Hyaline-like cartilage tissues, engineered from autologous nasal chondrocytes, can be used clinically for repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Future studies are warranted to assess efficacy in large controlled trials and to investigate an extension of indications to early degenerative states or to other joints. {FUNDING}: Deutsche Arthrose-Hilfe.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, lung cancer, as a health problem in worldwide, has high mortality both in men and women. Despite advances in diagnosis and surgical techniques of lung cancer in recent decades, chemotherapy is still a fundamentally and extensively useful strategy. Vinca alkaloids are a class of important and widely used drugs in the treatment of lung cancer, targeting on the Vinca binding site at the exterior of microtubule plus ends. Either intrinsic or acquired resistance to chemotherapy of Vinca alkaloids has been a major obstacle to the treatment of lung cancer, which arose great interests in studies of understanding and overcoming resistance. In this review, we focused on the application and resistance mechanisms of the Vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine and vinflunine in lung cancer. We reviewed characteristic resistance mechanisms in lung cancer including over-expression of {ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) transporters P-glycoprotein and structural, functional or expression alterations of β-tubulin (β{II}, β{III}, β{IV}) which may devote to the development of acquired resistance to the Vinca alkaloids; multidrug-resistance proteins ({MRP}1, {MRP}2, {MRP}3) and {RLIP}76 protein have also been identified that probably play a significant role in intrinsic resistance. Lung resistance-related protein ({LRP}) is contributed to lung cancer therapy resistance, but is not deal with the Vinca alkaloids resistance in lung cancer. Understanding the principle of the Vinca alkaloids in clinical application and mechanisms of drug resistance will support individualized lung cancer therapy and improve future therapies.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that the behavior of the interphase microtubule array is cell-type specific: microtubules in epithelial cells are less dynamic than microtubules in fibroblasts (Pepper-kok et al., 1990; Wadsworth and {McGrail}, 1990). To determine which parameters of microtubule dynamic instability behavior are responsible for this difference, we have examined the behavior of individual microtubules in both cell types after injection with rhodamine-labeled tubulin subunits. Individual microtubules in both cell types were observed to grow, shorten, and pause, as expected. The average amount of time microtubules remained within the lamellae of {CHO} fibroblasts, measured from images acquired at 10-s intervals, was significantly shorter than the average amount of time microtubules remained within lamellae of {PtK}1 epithelial cells. Further analysis of individual microtubule behavior from images acquired at 2-s intervals reveals that microtubules in {PtK}1 cells undergo multiple brief episodes of growth and shortening, resulting in little overall change in the microtubule network. In contrast, microtubules in lamellae of {CHO} fibroblasts are observed to undergo fewer transitions which are of longer average duration, resulting in substantial changes in the microtubule network over time. A small subset of more stable microtubules was also detected in {CHO} fibroblasts. Quantification of the various parameters of dynamic instability behavior from these sequences demonstrates that the average rates of both growth and shortening are significantly greater for the majority of microtubules in fibroblasts than for microtubules in epithelial cells (19.8 +/- 10.8 microns/min, 32.2 +/- 17.7 microns/min, 11.9 +/- 6.5 microns/min, and 19.7 +/- 8.1 microns/min, respectively). The frequency of catastrophe events (1/interval between catastrophe events) was similar in both cell types, but the frequency of rescue events (1/time spent shrinking) was significantly higher in {PtK}1 cells. Thus, individual microtubules in {PtK}1 lamellae undergo frequent excursions of short duration and extent, whereas most microtubules in {CHO} lamellae undergo more extensive excursions often resulting in the appearance or disappearance of microtubules within the field of view. These observations provide the first direct demonstration of cell-type specific behavior of individual microtubules in living cells, and indicate that these differences can be brought about by modulation of the frequency of rescue. These results directly support the view that microtubule dynamic instability behavior is regulated in a cell-type specific manner.},

Objectives: This study aimed to predict and develop the optimal fermentation conditions for periplasmic expression of {rhIFN}-β-1b in shake flasks whilst keeping the acetate excretion as the lowest amount and exploit the best results condition for {rhIFN}-β in a bench top bioreactor. Materials and Methods: The process variables studied were the concentration of glucose as carbon source, cell density prior the induction ({OD} 600 nm) and induction temperature. Ultimately, a three-factor three-level {BBD} was employed during the optimization process. The {rhIFN}-β production and the acetate excretion served as the evaluated responses. Results: The proposed optimum fermentation condition consisted of 7.81 g L-1 glucose, {OD} 600 nm prior induction 1.66 and induction temperature of 30.27°C. The model prediction of 0.267 g L-1 of {rhIFN}-β and 0.961 g L-1 of acetate at the optimum conditions was verified experimentally as 0.255 g L-1 and 0.981 g L-1 of acetate. This agreement between the predicted and observed values confirmed the precision of the applied method to predict the optimum conditions. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the {RSM} is an effective method for the optimization of recombinant protein expression using synthetic genes in E. coli.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis ({OA}) is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage, limited intraarticular inflammation with synovitis, and changes in peri-articular and subchondral bone. Multiple factors are involved in the pathogenesis of {OA}, including mechanical influences, the effects of aging on cartilage matrix composition and structure, and genetic factors. Since the initial stages of {OA} involve increased cell proliferation and synthesis of matrix proteins, proteinases, growth factors, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators by chondrocytes, research has focused on the chondrocyte as the cellular mediator of {OA} pathogenesis. The other cells and tissues of the joint, including the synovium and subchondral bone, also contribute to pathogenesis. The adult articular chondrocyte, which normally maintains the cartilage with a low turnover of matrix constituents, has limited capacity to regenerate the original cartilage matrix architecture. It may attempt to recapitulate phenotypes of early stages of cartilage development, but the precise zonal variations of the original cartilage cannot be replicated. Current pharmacological interventions that address chronic pain are insufficient, and no proven structure-modifying therapy is available. Cartilage tissue engineering with or without gene therapy is the subject of intense investigation. There are multiple animal models of {OA}, but there is no single model that faithfully replicates the human disease. This review will focus on questions currently under study that may lead to better understanding of mechanisms of {OA} pathogenesis and elucidation of effective strategies for therapy, with emphasis on mechanisms that affect the function of chondrocytes and interactions with surrounding tissues.},

In this study an expression vector was designed and constructed for expression of human {INF}-β-1b either in shake flasks or bench top bioreactor. The designed vector was constructed based upon {pET}-25b(+) with T7 promoter. Recombinant human beta interferon ({rhINF}-β) was codon optimized and overexpressed as a soluble, N-terminal {pelB} fusion protein and secreted into the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli {BL}21 ({DE}3). The sugar, Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside ({IPTG}) was used as a chemical inducer for {rhINF}-β production in the shake flasks and bench top bioreactor. Timing of beta interferon expression was controlled by using the T7 promoter. The {rhINF}-β protein was extracted from periplasmic space by osmotic shock treatment and the expression of the beta interferon encoding gene in random selected transformants, was confirmed by western and dot blot methods. The maximum of product formation achieved at the {OD}600nm = 3.42 was found to be 35 \% of the total protein content of the strain which translates to 0.32 g L-1. The constructed vector could efficiently overexpress the {rhINF}-β into the periplasmic space of E. coli. The obtained yield of the produced {rhINF}-β was more than previous reports. The system is easily adapted to include other vectors, tags or fusions and therefore has the potential to be broadly applicable to express other recombinant proteins.},

	abstract = {The field of regenerative medicine has increasingly recognized the importance to be inspired by developmental processes to identify signaling pathways crucial for 3D organogenesis and tissue regeneration. Here, we aimed at recapitulating the first events occurring during limb development (ie, cell condensation and expansion of an undifferentiated mesenchymal cell population) to prime 3D cultures of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells ({hBM}-{MSC}) toward the chondrogenic route. Based on embryonic development studies, we hypothesized that Wnt3a and fibroblast growth factor 2 ({FGF}2) induce {hBM}-{MSC} to proliferate in 3D culture as an undifferentiated pool of progenitors (defined by clonogenic capacity and expression of typical markers), retaining chondrogenic potential upon induction by suitable morphogens. {hBM}-{MSC} were responsive to Wnt signaling in 3D pellet culture, as assessed by significant upregulation of main target genes and increase of unphosphorylated β-catenin levels. Wnt3a was able to induce a five-fold increase in the number of proliferating {hBM}-{MSC} (6.4\% vs. 1.3\% in the vehicle condition), although total {DNA} content of the 3D construct was decreasing over time. Preconditioning with Wnt3a improved transforming growth factor-β1 mediated chondrogenesis (30\% more glycosaminoglycans/cell in average). In contrast to developmental and 2D {MSC} culture models, {FGF}2 antagonized the Wnt-mediated effects. Interestingly, the {CD}146⁺ subpopulation was found to be more responsive to Wnt3a. The presented data indicate a possible strategy to prime 3D cultures of {hBM}-{MSC} by invoking a "developmental engineering" approach. The study also identifies some opportunities and challenges to cross-fertilize skeletal development models and 3D {hBM}-{MSC} culture systems.},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ({MSC}) are typically used to generate bone tissue by a process resembling intramembranous ossification, i.e., by direct osteoblastic differentiation. However, most bones develop by endochondral ossification, i.e., via remodeling of hypertrophic cartilaginous templates. To date, endochondral bone formation has not been reproduced using human, clinically compliant cell sources. Here, we aimed at engineering tissues from bone marrow-derived, adult human {MSC} with an intrinsic capacity to undergo endochondral ossification. By analogy to embryonic limb development, we hypothesized that successful execution of the endochondral program depends on the initial formation of hypertrophic cartilaginous templates. Human {MSC}, subcutaneously implanted into nude mice at various stages of chondrogenic differentiation, formed bone trabeculae only when they had developed in vitro hypertrophic tissue structures. Advanced maturation in vitro resulted in accelerated formation of larger bony tissues. The underlying morphogenetic process was structurally and molecularly similar to the temporal and spatial progression of limb bone development in embryos. In particular, Indian hedgehog signaling was activated at early stages and required for the in vitro formation of hypertrophic cartilage. Subsequent development of a bony collar in vivo was followed by vascularization, osteoclastic resorption of the cartilage template, and appearance of hematopoietic foci. This study reveals the capacity of human {MSC} to generate bone tissue via an endochondral program and provides a valid model to study mechanisms governing bone development. Most importantly, this process could generate advanced grafts for bone regeneration by invoking a "developmental engineering" paradigm.},

Over the last years, these plus-end-tracking proteins, also called +{TIPs}, have attracted considerable interest because they are involved in a large variety of essential intracellular processes. {GFP}-labeled versions of {EB} proteins are also often used as markers for intracellular microtubule organization and dynamics. The mechanism of selective +{TIP} binding to the end region of growing microtubule was unknown. Recently, the phenomenon of end tracking was reconstituted in vitro from purified proteins, which allowed the identification of {EB} proteins as the minimal core of the plus-end-tracking system and the dissection of the molecular mechanism of end tracking by these proteins. This in vitro reconstitution has started to be widely used for several +{TIPs} and promises to provide mechanistic insight into the functioning of the dynamic +{TIP} network at growing microtubule ends. Here, we describe the purification of {EB}1 and {CLIP}-170, the total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy assay to observe dynamic end tracking in vitro, and the quantitative analysis of fluorescent +{TIP} comet shape and of single +{TIP} molecule turnover at growing microtubule ends.},

Growing microtubule plus ends have emerged as dynamic regulatory sites in which specialized proteins, called plus-end-binding proteins (+{TIPs}), bind and regulate the proper functioning of microtubules. However, the molecular mechanism of plus-end association by +{TIPs} and their ability to track the growing end are not well understood. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of a minimal plus-end tracking system consisting of the three fission yeast proteins Mal3, Tip1 and the kinesin Tea2. Using time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the {EB}1 homologue Mal3 has an enhanced affinity for growing microtubule end structures as opposed to the microtubule lattice. This allows it to track growing microtubule ends autonomously by an end recognition mechanism. In addition, Mal3 acts as a factor that mediates loading of the processive motor Tea2 and its cargo, the Clip170 homologue Tip1, onto the microtubule lattice. The interaction of all three proteins is required for the selective tracking of growing microtubule plus ends by both Tea2 and Tip1. Our results dissect the collective interactions of the constituents of this plus-end tracking system and show how these interactions lead to the emergence of its dynamic behaviour. We expect that such in vitro reconstitutions will also be essential for the mechanistic dissection of other plus-end tracking systems.},

Such a negative correlation is predicted by the standard {GTP}-cap model, which posits that catastrophe is due to loss of a stabilizing cap of {GTP}-tubulin at the end of a growing microtubule. However, many other {MAPs}, notably Kinesin-4 and combinations of {EB}1 with {XMAP}215, contradict this general rule.

L'angiogenèse ostéochondrale pourrait être impliquée dans l'{OA} mais les mécanismes moléculaires qui la gouvernent restent inconnus. Nous supposons qu'au cours de l'{OA}, la différenciation hypertrophique des chondrocytes jouerait un rôle clé dans le remodelage de la jonction ostéochondrale et notamment dans l'angiogenèse à travers un déséquilibre entre la production de facteurs angiogéniques et angiostatiques.

Le potentiel angiogénique des chondrocytes hypertrophiques a été étudié dans un modèle de différenciation hypertrophique de chondrocytes articulaires murins en culture primaire. Les chondrocytes articulaires expriment les marqueurs chondrocytaires (Sox9, Acan, Col2a1), tandis que l'expression des marqueurs de l'hypertrophie (Runx2, {OC}, Osx) augmente avec la différenciation hypertrophique.

Le «concept diamant» avec ses quatre éléments fondamentaux permet d'approcher les problèmes actuels de la création d'un tissu osseux au laboratoire. Les facteurs de croissance s'avèrent la clé de voûte qui permet la stimulation des cellules souches. Le développement d'un tissu osseux passe par une succession d'évènements cellulaires dictés par des facteurs de croissance et implique la prolifération, la différenciation et la minéralisation. Les travaux présentés dans cette thèse, de part 1 'utilisation de techniques in vitro, me permettent de dire que: 1) J'ai démontré que le facteur {EGF} stimule la prolifération des ostéoblastes et que son effet est amplifié par les facteurs {BMP}-2 et {BMP}-7. Aussi, la formation de nodules à 28 jours est fortement réduite en présence de l'{EGF}. Ainsi, l'{EGF} est un facteur d'intérêt dans les stades précoces mais moins dans les évènements tardifs, comme au moment de la formation de nodules minéralisés. 2) J'ai identifié les voies de signalisation {ERKl}/2, {JNKl}/2 et {SMADs} qui régissent la prolifération dans des cultures d'ostéoblastes dérivés de cellules humaines souches pulpaires ({hDPSCs}) différenciées, par une co-stimulation avec le {FGF}-2 et la {BMP}-2.

De fait, la formation de nodules à 28 jours était fortement réduite en présence du {FGF} -2.

	issn = {0009-921X},
	abstract = {Osteoarthrosis is a physiologic imbalance, a "joint failure" similar to "heart failure," in which mechanical factors play a role. The initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena. One of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone. Progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone. In such situations, transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue. The most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms. The health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed. In certain models of osteoarthrosis, alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions. Stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation, which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load.},

As a progressive degenerative joint disorder, {OA} is characterized by cartilage damage, changes in the subchondral bone, osteophyte formation, muscle weakness, and inflammation of the synovium tissue and tendon. Although {OA} has long been viewed as a primary disorder of articular cartilage, subchondral bone is attracting increasing attention. It is commonly reported to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of {OA}. Subchondral bone sclerosis, together with progressive cartilage degradation, is widely considered as a hallmark of {OA}. Despite the increase in bone volume fraction, subchondral bone is hypomineralized, due to abnormal bone remodeling. Some histopathological changes in the subchondral bone have also been detected, including microdamage, bone marrow edema-like lesions and bone cysts. This review summarizes basic features of the osteochondral junction, which comprises subchondral bone and articular cartilage. Importantly, we discuss risk factors influencing subchondral bone integrity. We also focus on the microarchitectural and histopathological changes of subchondral bone in {OA}, and provide an overview of their potential contribution to the progression of {OA}. A hypothetical model for the pathogenesis of {OA} is proposed.},

Healing can occur at this stage by correcting the abnormal loads. Persistence leads to what is thought to be a delayed union or nonunion response by the bone.Microfractures of the osteochondral junction, coupled with articular cartilage fissuring and loss, allows synovial fluid to penetrate the subchondral bone along with cytokines and other molecules reacting with the bone cells to increase the pathological effects.This review gives an overview of the current thoughts on subchondral bone remodelling in osteoarthritis that is aimed at orthopaedic surgeons to help in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and the role of surgical management.

There is increasing evidence showing that even minor alteration of microtubule dynamics can engage the spindle checkpoint, arresting cell-cycle progression at mitosis and subsequently leading to cell death. Our improved understanding of tumor biology and our continued appreciation for what the microtubule targeting agents ({MTAs}) can do have helped pave the way for a new era in the treatment of cancer. The effectiveness of these agents for cancer therapy has been impaired, however, by various side effects and drug resistance. Several new {MTAs} have shown potent activity against the proliferation of various cancer cells, including resistance to the existing {MTAs}. Sustained investigation of the mechanisms of action of {MTAs}, development and discovery of new drugs, and exploring new treatment strategies that reduce side effects and circumvent drug resistance could provide more effective therapeutic options for patients with cancer.

We hypothesized that, in living cells, suppression of microtubule dynamics is responsible for the ability of taxol to inhibit mitotic progression and cell proliferation. Using quantitative fluorescence video microscopy, we examined the effects of taxol (30–100 {nM}) on the dynamics of individual microtubules in two living human tumor cell lines: Caov-3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells and A-498 kidney carcinoma cells. Taxol accumulated more in Caov-3 cells than in A-498 cells. At equivalent intracellular taxol concentrations, dynamic instability was inhibited similarly in the two cell lines. Microtubule shortening rates were inhibited in Caov-3 cells and in A-498 cells by 32 and 26\%, growing rates were inhibited by 24 and 18\%, and dynamicity was inhibited by 31 and 63\%, respectively. All mitotic spindles were abnormal, and many interphase cells became multinucleate (Caov-3, 30\%; A-498, 58\%). Taxol blocked cell cycle progress at the metaphase/anaphase transition and inhibited cell proliferation. The results indicate that suppression of microtubule dynamics by taxol deleteriously affects the ability of cancer cells to properly assemble a mitotic spindle, pass the metaphase/anaphase checkpoint, and produce progeny.},

Restoration of the diseased articular cartilage in patients with {OA} is, therefore, a challenge of considerable appeal to researchers and clinicians. Techniques that cause multipotent adult mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) to differentiate into cells of the chondrogenic lineage have led to a variety of experimental strategies to investigate whether {MSCs} instead of chondrocytes can be used for the regeneration and maintenance of articular cartilage. {MSC}-based strategies should provide practical advantages for the patient with {OA}. These strategies include use of {MSCs} as progenitor cells to engineer cartilage implants that can be used to repair chondral and osteochondral lesions, or as trophic producers of bioactive factors to initiate endogenous regenerative activities in the {OA} joint. Targeted gene therapy might further enhance these activities of {MSCs}. Delivery of {MSCs} might be attained by direct intra-articular injection or by graft of engineered constructs derived from cell-seeded scaffolds; this latter approach could provide a three-dimensional construct with mechanical properties that are congruous with the weight-bearing function of the joint. Promising experimental and clinical data are beginning to emerge in support of the use of {MSCs} for regenerative applications.},

Current pathophysiological concepts focus on {OA} as a disease of the whole joint. Within these models, the functional unit formed by the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone seems to be of particular interest. Cartilage and bone receive and dissipate the stress associated with movement and loading, and are therefore continuously challenged biomechanically. Recent data support the view that cartilage and bone can communicate over the calcified tissue barrier; vessels reach out from bone into the cartilage zone, patches of uncalcified cartilage are in contact with bone, and microcracks and fissures further facilitate transfer of molecules. Several molecular signaling pathways such as bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnts are hypothesized to have a role in {OA} and can activate cellular and molecular processes in both cartilage and bone cells. In addition, intracellular activation of different kinase cascades seems to be involved in the molecular crosstalk between cartilage and bone cells. Further research is required to integrate these different elements into a comprehensive approach that will increase our understanding of the disease processes in {OA}, and that could lead to the development of specific therapeutics or treatment strategies.},

This developmental sequence reappears during fracture repair and in osteoarthritic etiopathology. These similarities suggest that {EO}, and the cells involved, are of great clinical importance for bone regeneration as it could provide novel targeted approaches to increase specific signaling to promote fracture healing, and if regulated appropriately in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The long-held accepted dogma states that hypertrophic chondrocytes are terminally differentiated and will eventually undergo apoptosis. In this mini review, we will explore recent evidence from experiments that revisit the idea that hypertrophic chondrocytes have pluripotent capacity and may instead transdifferentiate into a specific sub-population of osteoblast cells. There are multiple lines of evidence, including our own, showing that local, selective alterations in cartilage extracellular matrix ({ECM}) remodeling also indelibly alter bone quality. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that osteoblast behavior in long bones is regulated by a combination of their lineage origins and the epigenetic effects of chondrocyte-derived {ECM} which they encounter during their recruitment. Further exploration of these processes could help to unlock potential novel targets for bone repair and regeneration and in the treatment of osteoarthritis.},

The molecule adopts a fold similar to that of the previously determined structures of murine {IFN}-β and human {IFN}-α2b but displays several distinct structural features. Like human {IFN}-α2b, human {IFN}-β contains a zinc-binding site at the interface of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, raising the question of functional relevance for {IFN}-β dimers. However, unlike the human {IFN}-α2b dimer, in which homologous surfaces form the interface, human {IFN}-β dimerizes with contact surfaces from opposite sides of the molecule. The relevance of the structure to the effects of point mutations in {IFN}-β at specific exposed residues is discussed. A potential role of ligand–ligand interactions in the conformational assembly of {IFN} receptor components is discussed.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) transporters represent one of the largest and oldest families of membrane proteins in all extant phyla from prokaryotes to humans, which couple the energy derived from {ATP} hydrolysis essentially to translocate, among various substrates, toxic compounds across the membrane. The fundamental functions of these multiple transporter proteins include: (1) conserved mechanisms related to nutrition and pathogenesis in bacteria, (2) spore formation in fungi, and (3) signal transduction, protein secretion and antigen presentation in eukaryotes. Moreover, one of the major causes of multidrug resistance ({MDR}) and chemotherapeutic failure in cancer therapy is believed to be the {ABC} transporter-mediated active efflux of a multitude of structurally and mechanistically distinct cytotoxic compounds across membranes. It has been postulated that {ABC} transporter inhibitors known as chemosensitizers may be used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The current paper reviews the advance in the past decade in this important domain of cancer chemoresistance and summarizes the development of new compounds and the re-evaluation of compounds originally designed for other targets as transport inhibitors of {ATP}-dependent drug efflux pumps.},

	doi = {10.1111/jnc.14853},
	abstract = {Mutations are at the root of many human diseases. Still, we largely do not exactly understand how they trigger pathogenesis. One, more recent, hypothesis has been that they comprehensively perturb protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks and significantly alter key biological processes. Under this premise, many rare genetic disorders with Mendelian inheritance, like Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias, are likely to be caused by complex genotype-phenotype relationships involving abnormal {PPIs}. These altered {PPI} networks and their effects on cellular pathways are poorly understood at the molecular level. In this review, we focus on {PPIs} that are perturbed by the expanded pathogenic polyglutamine tract in huntingtin ({HTT}), the protein which, in its mutated form, leads to the autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative Huntington's disease. One aspect of perturbed mutant {HTT} interactions is the formation of abnormal protein species such as fibrils or large neuronal inclusions as a result of homotypic and heterotypic aberrant molecular interactions. This review focuses on abnormal {PPIs} that are associated with the assembly of mutant {HTT} aggregates in cells and their potential relevance in disease. Furthermore, the mechanisms and pathobiological processes that may contribute to phenotype development, neuronal dysfunction and toxicity in Huntington's disease brains are also discussed.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review Articular chondrocytes are exclusively responsible for the turnover of the extracellular matrix ({ECM}) of hyaline cartilage. However, chondrocytes are phenotypically unstable and, if they de-differentiate into hypertrophic or fibroblastic forms, will produce a defective and weak matrix. Chondrocyte volume and morphology exert a strong influence over phenotype and a full appreciation of the factors controlling chondrocyte phenotype stability is central to understanding (a) the mechanisms underlying the cartilage failure in osteoarthritis ({OA}), (b) the rationale for hyaline cartilage repair, and (c) the strategies for improving the engineering of resilient cartilage. The focus of this review is on the factors involved in, and the importance of regulating, chondrocyte morphology and volume as key controllers of chondrocyte phenotype. Recent Findings The visualisation of fluorescently-labelled in situ chondrocytes within non-degenerate and mildly degenerate cartilage, by confocal scanning laser microscopy ({CLSM}) and imaging software, has identified the marked heterogeneity of chondrocyte volume and morphology. The presence of chondrocytes with cytoplasmic processes, increased volume, and clustering suggests important early changes to their phenotype. Results from experiments more closely aligned to the normal physico-chemical environment of in situ chondrocytes are emphasising the importance of understanding the factors controlling chondrocyte morphology and volume that ultimately affect phenotype. Summary An appreciation of the importance of chondrocyte volume and morphology for controlling the chondrocyte phenotype is advancing at a rapid pace and holds particular promise for developing strategies for protecting the chondrocytes against deleterious changes and thereby maintaining healthy and resilient cartilage.},

These microtubules are involved in positioning the nucleus at the cell equator and in the establishment of cell polarity. At mitosis, the interphase array disappears and is replaced by an intranuclear spindle extending between the now duplicated {SPBs}. Elongation of the spindle sees the appearance of astral microtubules emanating from the cytoplasmic face of the {SPBs}. These persist until the end of anaphase whereupon the spindle microtubules depolymerize and two microtubule organizing centres ({MTOCs}) at the cell equator re-establish the interphase array. We have used the unique properties of various cell division cycle mutants to investigate further the function of these different microtubule arrays and their temporal and positional control.},

Based on this fixed-cell assay with static end points, {VHL} has been reported to directly stabilize the {MT} cytoskeleton. To investigate the dynamic changes in {MTs} induced by {VHL} in living cells, we measured the influence of {VHL} on tubulin turnover using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ({FRAP}). To this end, we engineered {VHL}-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells to constitutively incorporate fluorescently labeled tubulin and to inducibly express {VHL}. Induction of {VHL} in these cells resulted in a decrease of tubulin turnover as measured by {FRAP} at the cell periphery, while minimally influencing {MT} dynamics around the centrosome. Our data indicates that {VHL} changes the behavior of {MTs} dependent on their subcellular localization implying a role for {VHL} in cellular processes such as migration, polarization, and cell–cell interactions. Here we propose a complementary method to directly measure {VHL}-induced subcellular changes in microtubule dynamics, which may serve as a tool to study the effect of {MT} binding proteins such as {VHL}.},

The development of therapies for {HD} requires preclinical testing of drugs in animal models that reproduce the dysfunction and regionally specific pathology observed in {HD}. We have developed a new knock-in mouse model of {HD} with a chimeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 {CAG} repeats inserted in the murine huntingtin gene. These mice displayed an increased locomotor activity and rearing at 1 month of age, followed by hypoactivity at 4 months and gait anomalies at 1 year. Behavioral symptoms preceded neuropathological anomalies, which became intense and widespread only at 4 months of age. These consisted of nuclear staining for huntingtin and huntingtin-containing nuclear and neuropil aggregates that first appeared in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Interestingly, regions with early pathology all receive dense dopaminergic inputs, supporting accumulating evidence for a role of dopamine in {HD} pathology. Nuclear staining and aggregates predominated in striatum and layer {II}/{III} and deep layer V of the cerebral cortex, whereas neuropil aggregates were found in the globus pallidus and layer {IV}/superficial layer V of the cerebral cortex. The olfactory system displayed early and marked aggregate accumulation, which may be relevant to the early deficit in odor discrimination observed in patients with {HD}. Because of their early behavioral anomalies and regionally specific pathology, these mice provide a powerful tool with which to evaluate the effectiveness of new therapies and to study the mechanisms involved in the neuropathology of {HD}.},

Therefore, we hypothesized that its sole microenvironmental blockade by either {VEGF} sequestration by soluble {VEGF} receptor-2 (Flk-1) or by antiangiogenic hyperbranched peptides could improve chondrogenesis of expanded human nasal chondrocytes ({NC}) freshly seeded on collagen scaffolds. Chondrogenesis of several {NC} donors was assessed either in vitro or ectopically in nude mice. {VEGF} blockade appeared not to affect {NC} in vitro differentiation, whereas it efficiently inhibited blood vessel ingrowth in vivo. After 8 weeks, in vivo glycosaminoglycan deposition was approximately two-fold higher when antiangiogenic approaches were used, as compared to the control group.

	abstract = {Hippo signaling controls organ size and tissue regeneration in many organs, but its roles in chondrocyte differentiation and bone repair remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Yap1, an effector of Hippo pathway inhibits skeletal development, postnatal growth, and bone repair. We show that Yap1 regulates chondrocyte differentiation at multiple steps in which it promotes early chondrocyte proliferation but inhibits subsequent chondrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that Yap1 requires Teads binding for direct regulation of Sox6 expression to promote chondrocyte proliferation. In contrast, Yap1 inhibits chondrocyte maturation by suppression of Col10a1 expression through interaction with Runx2. In addition, Yap1 also governs the initiation of fracture repair by inhibition of cartilaginous callus tissue formation. Taken together, our work provides insights into the mechanism by which Yap1 regulates endochondral ossification, which may help the development of therapeutic treatment for bone regeneration.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: β{III}-Tubulin ({TUBB}3) is predominantly expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems, while in normal non-neoplastic tissues it is barely detectable. By contrast, this cytoskeletal protein is abundant in a wide range of tumors. β{III}-Tubulin is linked to dynamic instability of microtubules ({MTs}), weakening the effects of agents interfering with {MT} polymerization. Based on this principle, early studies introduced the classical theory linking β{III}-tubulin with a mechanism of counteracting taxane activity and accordingly, prompted its investigation as a predictive biomarker of taxane resistance. {AREAS} {COVERED}: We reviewed 59 translational studies, including cohorts from lung, ovarian, breast, gastric, colorectal and various miscellaneous cancers subject to different chemotherapy regimens. {EXPERT} {OPINION}: β{III}-Tubulin functions more as a prognostic factor than as a predictor of response to chemotherapy. We believe this view can be explained by β{III}-tubulin's association with prosurvival pathways in the early steps of the metastatic process. Its prognostic response increases if combined with additional biomarkers that regulate its expression, since β{III}-tubulin can be expressed in conditions, such as estrogen exposure, unrelated to survival mechanisms and without any predictive activity. Additional avenues for therapeutic intervention could emerge if drugs are designed to directly target β{III}-tubulin and its mechanism of regulation.},

As a consequence, today's protein databases contain a huge amount of inconsistency, due to both natural variants and sequence prediction errors. {RESULTS}: We have developed a new method, called {SIBIS}, to detect such inconsistencies based on the evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments. A Bayesian framework, combined with Dirichlet mixture models, is used to estimate the probability of observing specific amino acids and to detect inconsistent or erroneous sequence segments. We evaluated the performance of {SIBIS} on a reference set of protein sequences with experimentally validated errors and showed that the sensitivity is significantly higher than previous methods, with only a small loss of specificity. We also assessed a large set of human sequences from the {UniProt} database and found evidence of inconsistency in 48\% of the previously uncharacterized sequences. We conclude that the integration of quality control methods like {SIBIS} in automatic analysis pipelines will be critical for the robust inference of structural, functional and phylogenetic information from these sequences. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Source code, implemented in C on a linux system, and the datasets of protein sequences are freely available for download at http://www.lbgi.fr/∼julie/{SIBIS}.},

The system has been tested on an extensive collection of vertebrate genes smaller than 15,000 bases. Results obtained show that, on average, 88\% of the predicted coding region for a transcription unit is actually coding, and 80\% of the actual coding is correctly predicted.

In addition, new models of the donor and acceptor splice signals are described which capture potentially important dependencies between signal positions. The model is applied to the problem of gene identification in a computer program, {GENSCAN}, which identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in genomic {DNA}. Novel features of the program include the capacity to predict multiple genes in a sequence, to deal with partial as well as complete genes, and to predict consistent sets of genes occurring on either or both {DNA} strands. {GENSCAN} is shown to have substantially higher accuracy than existing methods when tested on standardized sets of human and vertebrate genes, with 75 to 80\% of exons identified exactly.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Advances in sequencing technologies have led to the release of reference genomes and annotations for multiple individuals within more well-studied systems. While each of these new genome assemblies shares significant portions of synteny between each other, the annotated structure of gene models within these regions can differ. Of particular concern are split-gene misannotations, in which a single gene is incorrectly annotated as two distinct genes or two genes are incorrectly annotated as a single gene. These misannotations can have major impacts on functional prediction, estimates of expression, and many downstream analyses. {RESULTS}: We developed a high-throughput method based on pairwise comparisons of annotations that detect potential split-gene misannotations and quantifies support for whether the genes should be merged into a single gene model. We demonstrated the utility of our method using gene annotations of three reference genomes from maize (B73, {PH}207, and W22), a difficult system from an annotation perspective due to the size and complexity of the genome. On average, we found several hundred of these potential split-gene misannotations in each pairwise comparison, corresponding to 3-5\% of gene models across annotations. To determine which state (i.e. one gene or multiple genes) is biologically supported, we utilized {RNAseq} data from 10 tissues throughout development along with a novel metric and simulation framework. The methods we have developed require minimal human interaction and can be applied to future assemblies to aid in annotation efforts. {CONCLUSIONS}: Split-gene misannotations occur at appreciable frequency in maize annotations. We have developed a method to easily identify and correct these misannotations. Importantly, this method is generic in that it can utilize any type of short-read expression data. Failure to account for split-gene misannotations has serious consequences for biological inference, particularly for expression-based analyses.},

	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of repetitive stretches of {DNA} in genomes of organisms across the tree of life imposes fundamental challenges for sequencing, genome assembly, and automated annotation of genes and proteins. This multi-level problem can lead to errors in genome and protein databases that are often not recognized or acknowledged. As a consequence, end users working with sequences with repetitive regions are faced with 'ready-to-use' deposited data whose trustworthiness is difficult to determine, let alone to quantify. Here, we provide a review of the problems associated with tandem repeat sequences that originate from different stages during the sequencing-assembly-annotation-deposition workflow, and that may proliferate in public database repositories affecting all downstream analyses. As a case study, we provide examples of the Atlantic cod genome, whose sequencing and assembly were hindered by a particularly high prevalence of tandem repeats. We complement this case study with examples from other species, where mis-annotations and sequencing errors have propagated into protein databases. With this review, we aim to raise the awareness level within the community of database users, and alert scientists working in the underlying workflow of database creation that the data they omit or improperly assemble may well contain important biological information valuable to others.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is the method of choice when large numbers of sequences have to be obtained. While the technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer. According to our analysis, the index-{PCR} for sample preparation has no effect on the observed error rate, even though {PCR} is traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced error rates in {NGS}. In addition, we observed very persistent pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The average error rate determined was 0.24 ± 0.06\% per base and the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 ± 1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5′- and 3′-end, e.g., primer binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains very reproducible results. As phasing effects and other sequencing problems vary between equipment and individual setups, we recommend evaluation of error rates and types to all {NGS}-users to improve the quality and analysis of {NGS} data.},

	abstract = {We examine exon junctions near apparent amino acid insertions and deletions in alignments of orthologous protein-coding genes. In 1,917 ortholog families across nine oomycete genomes, 10–20\% of introns are near an alignment gap, indicating at first sight that splice-site displacements are frequent. We designed a robust algorithmic procedure for the delineation of intron-containing homologous regions, and combined it with a parsimony-based reconstruction of intron loss, gain, and splice-site shift events on a phylogeny. The reconstruction implies that 12\% of introns underwent an acceptor-site shift, and 10\% underwent a donor-site shift. In order to offset gene annotation problems, we amended the procedure with the reannotation of intron boundaries using alignment evidence. The corresponding reconstruction involves much fewer intron gain and splice-site shift events. The frequency of acceptor- and donor-side shifts drops to 4\% and 3\%, respectively, which are not much different from what one would expect by random codon insertions and deletions. In other words, gaps near exon junctions are mostly artifacts of gene annotation rather than evidence of sliding intron boundaries. Our study underscores the importance of using well-supported gene structure annotations in comparative studies. When transcription evidence is not available, we propose a robust ancestral reconstruction procedure that corrects misannotated intron boundaries using sequence alignments. The results corroborate the view that boundary shifts and complete intron sliding are only accidental in eukaryotic genome evolution and have a negligible impact on protein diversity.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12920-019-0524-5},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The ability to generate recombinant drug target proteins is important for drug discovery research as it facilitates the investigation of drug-target-interactions in vitro. To accomplish this, the target's exact protein sequence is required. Public databases, such as Ensembl, {UniProt} and {RefSeq}, are extensive protein and nucleotide sequence repositories. However, many sequences for non-human organisms are predicted by computational pipelines and may thus be incomplete or incorrect. This could lead to misinterpreted experimental outcomes due to gaps or errors in orthologous drug target sequences. Transcriptome analysis by {RNA}-Seq has been established as a standard method for gene expression analysis. Apart from this common application, paired-end {RNA}-Seq data can also be used to obtain full coverage {cDNA} sequences via de novo transcriptome assembly. {METHODS}: To assess whether de novo transcriptome assemblies can be used to determine a protein's sequence by searching the assembly for a known orthologous sequence, we generated 3 × 6 = 18 tissue specific assemblies (three organs: brain, kidney and liver; six species: human, mouse, rat, dog, pig and cynomolgus monkey). These assemblies and the manually curated human protein sequences from {UniProtKB}/Swiss-Prot were used in a reciprocal {BLAST} search to identify best matching hits. We automated and generalised our approach and present the a\&o-tool, a workflow which exploits de novo assemblies of paired-end {RNA}-Seq data and orthology information for target sequence validation and refinement across related species. Furthermore, the a\&o-tool extracts best hits' sequences from a reciprocal {BLAST} search, translates them into protein sequences, computes a multiple sequence alignment and quantifies the refinement. {RESULTS}: For the three human assemblies we observed a hit rate greater than 60\% with 100\% sequence coverage and identity. For assemblies from the other species we observed similar hit rates and coverage with highest identities for cynomolgus monkey. {CONCLUSIONS}: In summary, we show how to refine protein sequences using {RNA}-Seq data and sequence information from closely related species. With the a\&o-tool we provide a fully automated pipeline to perform refinement including {cDNA} translation and multiple sequence alignment for visual inspection. The major prerequisite for applying the a\&o-tool is high quality sequencing data.},

However, incomplete genome annotation and assignments of genes to functional annotation databases can lead to a substantial loss of information in downstream data analysis. To overcome this, we developed Mammalian Annotation Database tool ({MAdb}, https://madb.ethz.ch) to conveniently provide homologous gene information for selected mammalian species. The assignment between species is performed in three steps: (i) matching official gene symbols, (ii) using ortholog information contained in Ensembl Compara and (iii) pairwise {BLAST} comparisons of all transcripts. In addition, we developed a new tool ({AnnOverlappeR}) for the reliable assignment of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ({NCBI}) and Ensembl gene {IDs}. The gene lists translated to gene {IDs} of well-annotated species such as a human can be used for improved functional annotation with relevant tools based on Gene Ontology and molecular pathway information. We tested the {MAdb} on a published {RNA}-seq data set for the pig and showed clearly improved overrepresentation analysis results based on the assigned human homologous gene identifiers. Using the {MAdb} revealed a similar list of human homologous genes and functional annotation results regardless of whether starting with gene {IDs} from {NCBI} or Ensembl. The {MAdb} database is accessible via a web interface and a Galaxy application.},

	abstract = {The study of nonhuman primates ({NHP}) is key to understanding human evolution, in addition to being an important model for biomedical research. {NHPs} are especially important for translational medicine. There are now exciting opportunities to greatly increase the utility of these models by incorporating Next Generation ({NextGen}) sequencing into study design. Unfortunately, the draft status of nonhuman genomes greatly constrains what can currently be accomplished with available technology. Although all genomes contain errors, draft assemblies and annotations contain so many mistakes that they make currently available nonhuman primate genomes misleading to investigators conducting evolutionary studies; and these genomes are of insufficient quality to serve as references for {NextGen} studies. Fortunately, {NextGen} sequencing can be used in the production of greatly improved genomes. Existing Sanger sequences can be supplemented with {NextGen} whole genome, and exomic genomic sequences to create new, more complete and correct assemblies. Additional physical mapping, and an incorporation of information about gene structure, can be used to improve assignment of scaffolds to chromosomes. In addition, {mRNA}-sequence data can be used to economically acquire transcriptome information, which can be used for annotation. Some highly polymorphic and complex regions, for example {MHC} class I and immunoglobulin loci, will require extra effort to properly assemble and annotate. However, for the vast majority of genes, a modest investment in money, and a somewhat greater investment in time, can greatly improve assemblies and annotations sufficient to produce true, reference grade nonhuman primate genomes. Such resources can reasonably be expected to transform nonhuman primate research.},

Following filters applied through assessment of true expression and frame selection, open-source tools are leveraged to functionally annotate the reduced set of translated proteins. Downstream features include fast similarity search across five repositories, protein domain assignment, orthologous gene family assessment, and Gene Ontology ({GO}) term assignment. The final annotation integrates across multiple databases and selects an optimal assignment from a combination of weighted metrics describing similarity search score, taxonomic relationship, and informativeness. Researchers have the option to include additional filters to identify and remove contaminants, identify associated pathways, and prepare the transcripts for enrichment analysis.

As an illustration, we applied the approach to 20 commonly-studied species in two recent {UniProt}-{GOA} releases and identified 250 potential misannotations in the 2018-11-6 release, where only 25\% of them were corrected in the 2019-6-3 release. Importantly, 56\% of the misannotations are "Inferred from Biological aspect of Ancestor ({IBA})" which is in contradiction with previous observations that attributed misannotations mainly to "Inferred from Sequence or structural Similarity ({ISS})", probably reflecting an error source shift due to the new developments of function annotation databases. The results demonstrated a simple but efficient misannotation detection approach that is useful for large-scale comparative protein function studies. {AVAILABILITY}: https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/{RAR}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The shift to the genome scale in evolutionary biology, for example, has led to many interesting, but often controversial studies. It has been suggested that part of the conflict may be due to errors in the initial sequences. Most gene sequences are predicted by bioinformatics programs and a number of quality issues have been raised, concerning {DNA} sequencing errors or badly predicted coding regions, particularly in eukaryotes. {RESULTS}: We investigated the impact of these errors on evolutionary studies and specifically on the identification of important genetic events. We focused on the detection of asymmetric evolution after duplication, which has been the subject of controversy recently. Using the human genome as a reference, we established a reliable set of 688 duplicated genes in 13 complete vertebrate genomes, where significantly different evolutionary rates are observed. We estimated the rates at which protein sequence errors occur and are accumulated in the higher-level analyses. We showed that the majority of the detected events (57\%) are in fact artifacts due to the putative erroneous sequences and that these artifacts are sufficient to mask the true functional significance of the events. {CONCLUSIONS}: Initial errors are accumulated throughout the evolutionary analysis, generating artificially high rates of event predictions and leading to substantial uncertainty in the conclusions. This study emphasizes the urgent need for error detection and quality control strategies in order to efficiently extract knowledge from the new genome data.},

The benchmark is based on a carefully validated and curated set of real eukaryotic genes from 147 phylogenetically disperse organisms, and a number of test sets are defined to evaluate the effects of different features, including genome sequence quality, gene structure complexity, protein length, etc. We used the benchmark to perform an independent comparative analysis of the most widely used ab initio gene prediction programs and identified the main strengths and weaknesses of the programs. More importantly, we highlight a number of features that could be exploited in order to improve the accuracy of current prediction tools. {CONCLUSIONS}: The experiments showed that ab initio gene structure prediction is a very challenging task, which should be further investigated.

These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content, ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs might be accomplished during development. In other more differentiated cells, super-enhancers containing cell-type-specific master transcription factors are also found at genes that define cell identity.

In this review, we attempt to address open questions regarding the role of epigenetic changes in {HD}, in the light of recent advances in neuroepigenetics. We particularly discuss studies using genome-wide scale approaches that provide insights into the relationship between epigenetic regulations, gene expression and neuronal activity in normal and diseased neurons, including {HD} neurons. We propose that cell-type specific techniques and 3D-based methods will advance knowledge of epigenome in the context of brain region vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes and of their consequences in neurodegenerative diseases is required to design therapeutic strategies more effective than current strategies based on histone deacetylase ({HDAC}) inhibitors. Researches in {HD} may play a driving role in this process.},

Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.},

	abstract = {Most eukaryotic genes contain introns, which are noncoding sequences that are removed during {premRNA} processing. Introns are usually preserved across evolutionary time. However, the sizes of introns vary greatly. In Arabidopsis, some introns are longer than 10 kilo base pairs (bp) and others are predicted to be shorter than 10 bp. To identify the shortest intron in the genome, we analyzed the predicted introns in annotated version 10 of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome and found 103 predicted introns that are 30 bp or shorter, which make up only 0.08\% of all introns in the genome. However, our own bioinformatics and experimental analyses found no evidence for the existence of these predicted introns. The predicted introns of 30–39 bp, 40–49 bp, and 50–59 bp in length are also rare and constitute only 0.07\%, 0.2\%, and 0.28\% of all introns in the genome, respectively. An analysis of 30 predicted introns 31–59 bp long verified two in this range, both of which were 59 bp long. Thus, this study suggests that there is a limit to how small introns in A. thaliana can be, which is useful for the understanding of the evolution and processing of small introns in plants in general.},

	abstract = {Accurate gene prediction in eukaryotes is a difficult and subtle problem. Here we point out a useful feature of expected distributions of spliceosomal intron lengths. Since introns are removed from transcripts prior to translation, intron lengths are not expected to respect coding frame, thus the number of genomic introns that are a multiple of three bases (‘3n introns’) should be similar to the number that are a multiple of three plus one bases (or plus two bases). Skewed predicted intron length distributions thus suggest systematic errors in intron prediction. For instance, a genome-wide excess of 3n introns suggests that many internal exonic sequences have been incorrectly called introns, whereas a deficit of 3n introns suggests that many 3n introns that lack stop codons have been mistaken for exonic sequence. A survey of genomic annotations for 29 diverse eukaryotic species showed that skew in intron length distributions is a common problem. We discuss several examples of skews in genome-wide intron length distributions that indicate systematic problems with gene prediction. We suggest that evaluation of length distributions of predicted introns is a fast and simple method for detecting a variety of possible systematic biases in gene prediction or even problems with genome assemblies, and discuss ways in which these insights could be incorporated into genome annotation protocols.},

We identified 184 splice sites with non-canonical dinucleotides and U2/U12-like consensus sequences. We selected 10 of the herein identified U2/U12-like non-canonical splice site events and successfully validated 9 of them via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Analyses of the 184 U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites indicate that 51\% of them are not annotated in {GENCODE}. In addition, 28\% of them are conserved in mouse and 76\% are involved in alternative splicing events, some of them with tissue-specific alternative splicing patterns. Interestingly, our analysis identified some U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites that are converted into canonical splice sites by {RNA} A-to-I editing. Moreover, the U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites have a differential distribution of splicing regulatory sequences, which may contribute to their recognition and regulation. Our analysis provides a high-confidence group of U2/U12-like non-canonical splice sites, which exhibit distinctive features among the total human splice sites.},

	abstract = {A set of 43 337 splice junction pairs was extracted from mammalian {GenBank} annotated genes. Expressed sequence tag ({EST}) sequences support 22 489 of them. Of these, 98.71\% contain canonical dinucleotides {GT} and {AG} for donor and acceptor sites, respectively; 0.56\% hold non-canonical {GC}-{AG} splice site pairs; and the remaining 0.73\% occurs in a lot of small groups (with a maximum size of 0.05\%). Studying these groups we observe that many of them contain splicing dinucleotides shifted from the annotated splice junction by one position. After close examination of such cases we present a new classification consisting of only eight observed types of splice site pairs (out of 256 a priori possible combinations). {EST} alignments allow us to verify the exonic part of the splice sites, but many non-canonical cases may be due to intron sequencing errors. This idea is given substantial support when we compare the sequences of human genes having non-canonical splice sites deposited in {GenBank} by high throughput genome sequencing projects ({HTG}). A high proportion (156 out of 171) of the human non-canonical and {EST}-supported splice site sequences had a clear match in the human {HTG}. They can be classified after corrections as: 79 {GC}-{AG} pairs (of which one was an error that corrected to {GC}-{AG}), 61 errors that were corrected to {GT}-{AG} canonical pairs, six {AT}-{AC} pairs (of which two were errors that corrected to {AT}-{AC}), one case was produced from non-existent intron, seven cases were found in {HTG} that were deposited to {GenBank} and finally there were only two cases left of supported non-canonical splice sites. If we assume that approximately the same situation is true for the whole set of annotated mammalian non-canonical splice sites, then the 99.24\% of splice site pairs should be {GT}-{AG}, 0.69\% {GC}-{AG}, 0.05\% {AT}-{AC} and finally only 0.02\% could consist of other types of non-canonical splice sites. We analyze several characteristics of {EST}-verified splice sites and build weight matrices for the major groups, which can be incorporated into gene prediction programs. We also present a set of {EST}-verified canonical splice sites larger by two orders of magnitude than the current one (22 199 entries versus {\textbackslash}textasciitilde600) and finally, a set of 290 {EST}-supported non-canonical splice sites.

	abstract = {Cabazitaxel is a novel taxane approved for treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer in patients pretreated with docetaxel. Cabazitaxel, docetaxel, and paclitaxel bind specifically to tubulin in microtubules, disrupting functions essential to tumor growth. High levels of β{III}-tubulin isotype expression are associated with tumor aggressivity and drug resistance. To understand cabazitaxel's increased efficacy, we examined binding of radio-labeled cabazitaxel and docetaxel to microtubules and the drugs' suppression of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro in microtubules assembled from purified bovine brain tubulin containing or devoid of β{III}-tubulin. We found that cabazitaxel suppresses microtubule dynamic instability significantly more potently in the presence of β{III}-tubulin than in its absence. In contrast, docetaxel showed no β{III}-tubulin-enhanced microtubule stabilization. We also asked if the selective potency of cabazitaxel on β{III}-tubulin-containing purified microtubules in vitro extends to cabazitaxel's effects in human tumor cells. Using {MCF}7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, we found that cabazitaxel also suppressed microtubule shortening rates, shortening lengths, and dynamicity significantly more strongly in cells with normal levels of β{III}-tubulin than after 50\% reduction of β{III}-tubulin expression by {siRNA} knockdown. Cabazitaxel also more strongly induced mitotic arrest in {MCF}7 cells with normal β{III}-tubulin levels than after β{III}-tubulin reduction. In contrast, docetaxel had little or no β{III}-tubulin-dependent selective effect on microtubule dynamics or mitotic arrest. The selective potency of cabazitaxel on purified β{III}-tubulin-containing microtubules and in cells expressing β{III}-tubulin suggests that cabazitaxel may be unusual among microtubule-targeted drugs in its superior anti-tumor efficacy in tumors overexpressing β{III}-tubulin.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: Relapse is common in acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) because of persistence of minimal residual disease ({MRD}). {ABC}-transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein ({MRP}), are thought to contribute to treatment failure, while it is unknown whether breast cancer resistance protein ({BCRP}) does so. However, whether up-regulation of pump activity or selection of subpopulations with higher pump activity occurs during chemotherapy is unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether {ABC}-transporter function changes during the course of disease. {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: {MRD} cells were identified using leukemia-associated phenotypes combined with a fluorescent probe assay with substrate/modulator: Syto16/ {PSC}833 (Pgp), calcein-{AM}/probenecid ({MRP}) and {BODIPY}-prazosin/Ko143 ({BCRP}); efflux profiles were directly compared with blasts at diagnosis and relapse from the same patient. {RESULTS}: At diagnosis {BCRP} activity was undetectable in {AML} blasts from 23/26 cases, while Pgp activity was present in 36/45 and {MRP} activity in 26/44 of the cases. Furthermore, no subpopulations of blasts with considerably higher drug efflux capacities were found. Overall, no consistent changes were observed at follow-up [during chemotherapy (n=20), {MRD} (n=37), relapse (n=26))] in forty-five patients, the mean activities (as percentages of values at diagnosis) were 97\% (Pgp), 103\% ({MRP}) and 102\% ({BCRP}). {INTERPRETATION} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}: Emergence of {MRD} is thus not accompanied by either upregulation of {ABC}-transporter function during or after chemotherapy or by selection of pre-existing highly resistant subpopulations. The prognostic value of Pgp and {MRP} is, therefore, likely related to drug efflux capacity homogeneously distributed in the whole blast population, while {BCRP} probably has a limited function in drug efflux-related resistance in {AML}.},

	abstract = {Huntington's disease ({HD}) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with extensive down-regulation of genes controlling neuronal function, particularly in the striatum. Whether altered epigenetic regulation underlies transcriptional defects in {HD} is unclear. Integrating {RNA}-sequencing ({RNA}-seq) and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing ({ChIP}-seq), we show that down-regulated genes in {HD} mouse striatum associate with selective decrease in H3K27ac, a mark of active enhancers, and {RNA} Polymerase {II} ({RNAPII}). In addition, we reveal that decreased genes in {HD} mouse striatum display a specific epigenetic signature, characterized by high levels and broad patterns of H3K27ac and {RNAPII}. Our results indicate that this signature is that of super-enhancers, a category of broad enhancers regulating genes defining tissue identity and function. Specifically, we reveal that striatal super-enhancers display extensive H3K27 acetylation within gene bodies, drive transcription characterized by low levels of paused {RNAPII}, regulate neuronal function genes and are enriched in binding motifs for Gata transcription factors, such as Gata2 regulating striatal identity genes. Together, our results provide evidence for preferential down-regulation of genes controlled by super-enhancers in {HD} striatum and indicate that enhancer topography is a major parameter determining the propensity of a gene to be deregulated in a neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Huntington disease is devastating to patients and their families - with autosomal dominant inheritance, onset typically in the prime of adult life, progressive course, and a combination of motor, cognitive and behavioural features. The disease is caused by an expanded {CAG} trinucleotide repeat (of variable length) in {HTT}, the gene that encodes the protein huntingtin. In mutation carriers, huntingtin is produced with abnormally long polyglutamine sequences that confer toxic gains of function and predispose the protein to fragmentation, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and death. In this Primer, we review the epidemiology of Huntington disease, noting that prevalence is higher than previously thought, geographically variable and increasing. We describe the relationship between {CAG} repeat length and clinical phenotype, as well as the concept of genetic modifiers of the disease. We discuss normal huntingtin protein function, evidence for differential toxicity of mutant huntingtin variants, theories of huntingtin aggregation and the many different mechanisms of Huntington disease pathogenesis. We describe the genetic and clinical diagnosis of the condition, its clinical assessment and the multidisciplinary management of symptoms, given the absence of effective disease-modifying therapies. We review past and present clinical trials and therapeutic strategies under investigation, including impending trials of targeted huntingtin-lowering drugs and the progress in development of biomarkers that will support the next generation of trials.

	doi = {10.1006/jmbi.2001.5077},
	abstract = {We present a refined model of the alpha beta-tubulin dimer to 3.5 A resolution. An improved experimental density for the zinc-induced tubulin sheets was obtained by adding 114 electron diffraction patterns at 40-60 degrees tilt and increasing the completeness of structure factor amplitudes to 84.7 \%. The refined structure was obtained using maximum-likelihood including phase information from experimental images, and simulated annealing Cartesian refinement to an R-factor of 23.2 and free R-factor of 29.7. The current model includes residues alpha:2-34, alpha:61-439, beta:2-437, one molecule of {GTP}, one of {GDP}, and one of taxol, as well as one magnesium ion at the non-exchangeable nucleotide site, and one putative zinc ion near the M-loop in the alpha-tubulin subunit. The acidic C-terminal tails could not be traced accurately, neither could the N-terminal loop including residues 35-60 in the alpha-subunit. There are no major changes in the overall fold of tubulin with respect to the previous structure, testifying to the quality of the initial experimental phases. The overall geometry of the model is, however, greatly improved, and the position of side-chains, especially those of exposed polar/charged groups, is much better defined. Three short protein sequence frame shifts were detected with respect to the non-refined structure. In light of the new model we discuss details of the tubulin structure such as nucleotide and taxol binding sites, lateral contacts in zinc-sheets, and the significance of the location of highly conserved residues.},

Previous studies of similar material fixed in {OSO}4 alone have disclosed discontinuities in the plasma membrane and other evidence of inadequate fixation. After glutaraldehyde, used as a fixative in this present study, the general preservation of cortical fine structure is greatly improved. This is shown, for example, by the first evidence of slender tubules, 230 to 270 A in diameter and of indeterminate length, in plant cells of this type. They have been found in the cortical regions of cells of two angiosperms and one gymnosperm, representing all the material so far studied following this method of fixation. The tubules are identical in morphology to those also observed here in the mitotic spindles of plant cells, except that the latter have a somewhat smaller diameter. It is noted that the cortical tubules are in a favored position to govern cytoplasmic streaming and to exert an influence over the disposition of cell wall materials. In this regard it may be of some significance that the tubules just beneath the surface of the protoplast mirror the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils of the adjacent cell walls.},

Cells processed through the {NaBH}(4) step show, in transmission electron microscopy, normal cytoplasmic microtubules approximately 250 A in diameter. When such cells are subjected to indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using monospecific tubulin antibody they reveal a complex system of unbroken, fine, fluorescent fibers traversing the cytoplasm between the perinuclear space and the plasma membrane. Thin sections of cells processed through the indirect immunofluorescence procedure show antibody-decorated microtubules with a diameter of approximately 600 A. This decoration is not obtained when non-immune {IgGs} are used instead of monospecific antitubulin {IgGs}.

	abstract = {Microtubules in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons are of nonuniform polarity orientation. About half of the microtubules have their plus ends oriented distal to the cell body, and the other half have their minus ends distal; in contrast, microtubules in the axon are of uniform polarity orientation, all having their plus ends distal (Baas, P.W., J.S. Deitch, M. M. Black, and G. A. Banker. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA}. 85:8335-8339). Here we describe the developmental changes that give rise to the distinct microtubule patterns of axons and dendrites. Cultured hippocampal neurons initially extend several short processes, any one of which can apparently become the axon (Dotti, C. G., and G. A. Banker. 1987. Nature [Lond.]. 330:477-479). A few days after the axon has begun its rapid growth, the remaining processes differentiate into dendrites (Dotti, C. G., C. A. Sullivan, and G. A. Banker. 1988. J. Neurosci. 8:1454-1468). The polarity orientation of the microtubules in all of the initial processes is uniform, with plus ends distal to the cell body, even through most of these processes will become dendrites. This uniform microtubule polarity orientation is maintained in the axon at all stages of its growth. The polarity orientation of the microtubules in the other processes remains uniform until they begin to grow and acquire the morphological characteristics of dendrites. It is during this period that microtubules with minus ends distal to the cell body first appear in these processes. The proportion of minus end-distal microtubules gradually increases until, by 7 d in culture, about equal numbers of dendritic microtubules are oriented in each direction. Thus, the establishment of regional differences in microtubule polarity orientation occurs after the initial polarization of the neuron and is temporally correlated with the differentiation of the dendrites.},

In our laboratory we have found that taxol, a low molecular weight neutral compound, completely inhibits division of exponentially growing {HeLa} cells at low concentrations of drug (0.25 µM) that have no significant effects on {DNA}, {RNA} or protein synthesis during a 4-h incubation with the cells. {HeLa} cells incubated with taxol for 20 h are blocked in late G2 and/or M (ref. 2). We report here that taxol acts as a promoter of calf brain microtubule assembly in vitro, in contrast to plant products such as colchicine and podophyllotoxin, which inhibit assembly. Taxol decreases the lag time for microtubule assembly and shifts the equilibrium for assembly in favour of the microtubule, thereby decreasing the critical concentration of tubulin required for assembly. Microtubules polymerised in the presence of taxol are resistant to depolymerisation by cold (4 °C) and {CaCl}2 (4 {mM}).},

The actual destruction of {MTs} by oryzalin was observed in a living cell. Cytochalasin B exerts no effect on the distribution pattern of {MTs}. The fluorescence intensity of {MTs} was different among cells in different tissues.},

	abstract = {αβ-tubulin dimers need to convert between a 'bent' conformation observed for free dimers in solution and a 'straight' conformation required for incorporation into the microtubule lattice. Here, we investigate the free energy landscape of αβ-tubulin using molecular dynamics simulations, emphasizing implications for models of assembly, and modulation of the conformational landscape by colchicine, a tubulin-binding drug that inhibits microtubule polymerization. Specifically, we performed molecular dynamics, potential-of-mean force simulations to obtain the free energy profile for unpolymerized {GDP}-bound tubulin as a function of the ∼12° intradimer rotation differentiating the straight and bent conformers. Our results predict that the unassembled {GDP}-tubulin heterodimer exists in a continuum of conformations ranging between straight and bent, but, in agreement with existing structural data, suggests that an intermediate bent state has a lower free energy (by ∼1 kcal/mol) and thus dominates in solution. In agreement with predictions of the lattice model of microtubule assembly, lateral binding of two αβ-tubulins strongly shifts the conformational equilibrium towards the straight state, which is then ∼1 kcal/mol lower in free energy than the bent state. Finally, calculations of colchicine binding to a single αβ-tubulin dimer strongly shifts the equilibrium toward the bent states, and disfavors the straight state to the extent that it is no longer thermodynamically populated.},
